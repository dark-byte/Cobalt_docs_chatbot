To incorporate repetitive actions or iterate over arrays within a workflow, users simply place the desired action nodes inside the Group Node and provide values for the input fields based on their requirements. ​ Actions The Group Node offers two distinct actions to choose from: Iterating Array Select this action when iterating over an array. When using this action, the user specifies the array to iterate over. Fixed Iteration Choose this action when you want to iterate a fixed number of times. With this action, users define the number of iterations. ​ Input Fields The input fields for the Group Node vary based on the selected action. In case of Iterating Array , you need to provide the array which will determine the no. of times the loop will be executed while in Fixed iteration , you simply provide the Number of Iterations . ​ Accessing Array Item inside Group Node To access the array item that is being passed in the Group Node, within any node for each iteration, it can be done so by calling array_item object. Consider you want to access an Id that is unique within each array item that is being passed in the Group Node. To do so, call the Group Node as a Variable under Nodes and write it as {{group:array_item.Id}} .
