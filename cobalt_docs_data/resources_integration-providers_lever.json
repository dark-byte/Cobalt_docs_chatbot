For your customers to provide you authorization to access their data, they would first need to install your application. This page lets you set up your application credentials. Cobalt lets you use pre-configured applications to play around. You can do so by selecting Use our credentials . However, if you wish to use your own application, select Use your own credentials . Provide the aquired Client Id and Client secret and save it. ​ Requesting permissions from your customers Cobalt lets you configure what permissions to ask from your users while they install your application. The scopes can be added or removed from the App settings page, under Permissions & Scopes section. Make sure that you only select among the scopes that were earlier requested to be added to your sandbox account. Click on save changes after selecting the scopes. That’s it, your users can now connect with your Lever applications through their auth flow setups. They would be requested permissions as per the scopes selected by you on the Cobalt app settings page. If you are facing scopes missing or invalid scope error. Make sure you are not passing any custom scope not supported by the platform. And, the scopes selected here are among the ones requested for Lever sandbox account. ​ Actions and triggers Once the above setup is completed, you can create orchestrations of your use-cases using Lever actions and triggers.
