You can send data from your apps to other apps by using Cobalt Events . An event model contains name of the event and the trigger payload. The trigger payload contains sample data schema that can be used as data variables and are used inside a workflow as placeholders while defining the workflow. To learn more about Cobalt Events, you can refer to our guide here . ​ Create Event Follow these steps to create an Event in Cobalt: Create Event : Navigate to Developer in Cobalt > Events > Click on New Event > Select a Model > Update the sample Payload to your requirements > Click on Create Event . It is expected that you pass on the data as the Sample Payload while you are triggering this event. This is because, the properties defined in the sample payload can be used as trigger variables inside a workflow. ​ Trigger an Event You can trigger an event that was created in Cobalt by using the Trigger Event API . Request : Make a POST request to the /event/:slug endpoint. linked_account_id is a mandatory field to be passed while making the request. Request curl -- request POST \\ -- url https : / / api . gocobalt . io / api / v2 / public / event / : slug \\ -- header 'Content-Type: application/json' \\ -- header 'linked_account_id: <linked_account_id>' \\ -- header 'x-api-key: <api-key>' \\ -- data ' { \"event\" : \"<string>\" , \"payload\" : { \"first_name\" : \"Mark\" , \"last_name\" : \"wood\" , \"employee_id\" : 221 , \"is_new\" : false , \"address\" : { \"house_no\" : \"221\" , \"street\" : \"lorem ipsum\" , \"pincode\" : 560103 } } ' Param Required Type Description linked_account_id Mandatory String Unique customer identifier event Mandatory String Name of the event payload Optional Object Event payload with user data required for the workflow. Response : On a successful request, you will get a message that the event was triggered successfully. 200 { \"message\" : \"Webhook Fired Success\" } Handle Errors : If the /event/:slug endpoint returns a 400 error, your server-side code should handle it gracefully. The error is returned if you provided the wrong name of the event. 400 { \"status_code\" : 400 , \"error_type\" : \"BAD_REQUEST\" , \"message\" : \"Trigger with name Wrong_Event not found for application 646370324e3b114f9c720719\" , \"request_id\" : \"fa6ad809-3a6d-4c3d-9b86-c2c0662f3f37\" } ​ Checkpoint You have now created an event in Cobalt and can send data from your app to other third party apps or integrations enabled in Cobalt.
