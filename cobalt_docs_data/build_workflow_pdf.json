This node supports two primary actions: Create PDF from HTML This action enables the conversion of an HTML file into a PDF document with customizable settings. User is required to provide the HTML that will be converted to a PDF. Once the node is successfully executed, the generated PDF is stored in an S3 bucket, and the link to the file is provided in the response. Optionally users can also configure other settings for the output PDF such as Page Layout , Format , Width and Height . The default format for the PDF is A4. If required, users can also specify a password to create a protected PDF document. Merge PDFs This action allows the merging of multiple PDFs into a single PDF. User is required to provide an array of URLs as an input for all the PDFs to be merged and can also set a password for the Merged PDF if required.
