You take inputs from your end customers to facilitate your desired orchestration. To do so, Cobalt supports various types of fields to define the settings. ​ Primitive field types Primitive field types are the basic input types defined by Cobalt. Text , Number , Select , Email & Date fields can be used by the users to take inputs with the respective types from the user. Using the Select field type, you can let you customers select from a list of options defined by you. The end customer can select a value from your defined options, which can then be used in a workflow orchestration. ​ Select field types There might arise conditions where you want your end customers to select from a list which is platform specific and cannot be configured using Primitive field types. For example, List of Stages or List of Tags . Such lists are platform specific and prone to changes. As a result hard coding the options using Primitive field types is not recommended. To cater to such issues, Cobalt provides Select Fields . To use Select fields, create a setting and select the type from the list of Select fields available. The users can then select from the options defined for the field which is fetched from the platform in real time. The below image shows the list of Pipedrive Select fields to choose from. ​ Mapping fields type If you want your users to map a platform defined list of properties to the triggers payload properties being sent by you, then you should select Map V2 type.
