This provides access to a wide range of variables, allowing users to select and utilize the appropriate data for their workflows. Each DataSlot variable is accompanied by its data type, displayed below the variable name. ​ Types of Dataslots Users can search for variables in the Dataslots. Dataslots in Cobalt are of two types: ​ DataSlots DataSlots encompass variables sourced from various sources, including triggers and configurations. They provide essential data for workflow execution and can be customized to suit specific requirements. Payload Variables These are the variables that are extracted from Triggers/Events payloads . Variables are listed based on the sequence of the Triggers configured in the Start node of the Workflow. Config Variables These are the variables that are defined in App config or Workflow config . In the list of DataSlot variables, these are present after the list of variables from the Triggers. ​ Nodes Nodes represent data from nodes present within the current workflow. They enable users to access and utilize data generated by previous workflow components, facilitating seamless data exchange and integration.
