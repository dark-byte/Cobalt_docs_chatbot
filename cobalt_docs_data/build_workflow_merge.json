This is particularly useful when there are parallel processes within a workflow that need to converge at a common point before proceeding with the subsequent actions. ​ Use Case for Merge Consider a scenario where two parallel processes need to run simultaneously, and once both processes are completed, a common action or set of actions should be executed. So rather than replicating the same flow for each branch, leading to increased complexity and a higher number of nodes, the Merge Node allows these branches to converge seamlessly. The Merge will not be successful if any of the nodes which are being merged through the Merge Node are failing. ​ Example Scenario Parallel Processing : You have three branches/nodes running different processes in parallel. Convergence : Once all three branches complete their respective tasks, they need to converge to perform a common action, such as creating a datastore or any other action. By using the Merge Node, you can bring both branches together, eliminating the need to duplicate the subsequent steps for each branch.
