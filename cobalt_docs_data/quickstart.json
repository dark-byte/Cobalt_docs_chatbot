This guide covers the key steps, including configuring credentials, setting up a workflow, and testing the workflows. Follow the steps given below to execute a demo workflow present in your account and get the response. ​ Step 1: Configure Your Integration Credentials The first step is to configure your credentials for the integration you want to test if required. Cobalt supports 2 types of Authentication: Key-based and OAuth 2.0 which you can check by navigating to your integration in Apps > Settings of the integration. For Key-Based If the integration is key-based, you would require your own API key and other credentials to authenticate with the integration and test it. To get your credentials, click on Read Documentation button present under Overview of the integration. If you are unable to find the steps of how you can get those API credentials, please contact us and we will provide the steps to you. OAuth Based If the integration is OAuth 2.0, then you will need to provide credentials of your app like Client ID and Client Secret OR you can also use our OAuth app credentials by choosing Use Our Credentials option. Follow these steps to configure your credentials: Navigate to the Overview in the integration > Click on Read documentation and you will be redirected to the OAuth app Setup doc for the respective integration. Create your integration credentials by following the setup guide, such as Client ID and Secret and add it in Settings and click on Save . For certain integrations like DocuSign, if your developer app isn’t published, you won’t be able to authenticate an account outside the developer environment. Alternatively, you can request us for a Demo account credentials for testing purposes. ​ Step 2: Workflow Setup Once your credentials are configured, you can also check the demo workflows already set in your account by navigating to Workflows in the integration. ​ Step 3: Set Up API Proxy In most integrations where you want to fetch some data, you’ll need to setup API proxy to capture workflow’s final response during testing. It’s not necessary that every workflow will have an API Proxy present, in that case you can skip this step. Learn more about API Proxy here . Follow the steps given below to setup your own URL where you can receive the response: Navigate to the workflow for which you want to configure your URL to receive the response. In the workflow, check the Native node present at the end of the workflow path and see the name of the Action that is present in that node. For eg: In the image above, the name of the API Proxy or Action present is Bulk Create Contacts . To get your own URL for setup, go to webhook.site and copy Your unique URL . In Cobalt, navigate to Developers > API Proxies > Search for the Action name that was setup in the workflow > Select it and paste the unique URL you copied under Request URL present in API Call and click on Save API Call . ​ Step 4: Authenticate Linked Account Next step is to perform authentication of a Linked Account to the integration, to link it to the workflow. Linked Accounts refers to the end-users or customers of our users who utilize the integrations built using the Cobalt platform. Go to Linked Accounts section in Cobalt and open any Linked Account present. You can also create a new linked account if you want by clicking on + Add Account button in the top right. Click on Get Hosted URL button > Generate Hosted URL > Copy the URL shown and open it in a new tab. Hosted Portal is a no-code solution built by Cobalt so that you don’t need to build your own UI to handle the integration authentication and configuration which we will now use for testing purposes. You can also build your own UI for end-users using our SDKs or APIs and Auth Flows . In the Hosted portal, navigate to the integration for which you want to perform authentication. If it’s OAuth simply click on Connect or provide credentials if it’s Key-based and click on Connect . If the authentication is successful you should see a Connected tag displayed beside the integration name. Next, enable the workflows which you want to test for the integration and click on Save . If the authentication was not successful, please ensure that all the steps in Setup doc of the integration were followed correctly. ​ Step 5: Test the Setup Now that everything is set up, you can proceed to test the workflow. Trigger of a Workflow can either be: Native App Trigger which triggers when a certain action is performed in the application. For eg: If the Contact Created trigger of HubSpot is present in the Start Node of your workflow, then it triggers when a new contact is added to your HubSpot account. Event based triggers which triggers when an event is called on Cobalt. You can check which Event is added to the workflow by checking the Start Node of the workflow. To start the workflow execution, go to Try API section in Cobalt, provide the required details and click on Fire Event . Once the Event is fired, you can see the Event and Execution logs of your workflow by navigating to Logs section. Also, if the workflow executed successfully, you can check the final response received on your webhook.site . Hurray! You have successfully completed setup for an integration and also executed the workflow to receive the final response. ​ Go Deeper and Explore Cobalt This was a simple overview to setup native integrations using Cobalt, and how Linked Accounts and workflows interact within the platform. You can further customize workflows, explore advanced testing scenarios, or discuss alternative UI implementations on a follow-up call.
