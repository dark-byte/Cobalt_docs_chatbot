You can create one here . ​ Required Settings Mandatory Scopes api:users:read If you haven’t already created an app in Gong, you’d need to create one. ​ Creating an app in Gong To create a Gong app and aquire the above mentioned credentials, please follow the steps mentioned below: Log in to your Gong Developer Hub . Go to your Gong Developer Hub > Click on Company Settings in the side menu > Go to Ecosystem > Select API . Click on Create Integration button under the Integrations tab.

Select the mandatory scopes in the Required authorization Scopes section during app creation, as provided in your Cobalt Gong settings page and click on the Save button. After the app is created, copy the Client ID and Client Secret of the app from the list of apps available under Integrations . ​ Configuring credentials in Cobalt App settings page lets you configure the authentication settings for an OAuth 2.0 based application. For your customers to provide you authorization to access their data, they would first need to install your application. This page lets you set up your application credentials. Cobalt lets you use pre-configured applications to play around. You can do so by selecting Use our credentials . However, if you wish to use your own application, select Use your own credentials . Provide the aquired Client Id and Client secret and save it. ​ Configuring Scopes Cobalt lets you configure what permissions to ask from your users while they install your application. The scopes can be added or removed from the App settings page, under Permissions & Scopes section. For some applications Cobalt sets mandatory scopes which cannot be removed. Additional scopes can be selected from the drop down. Cobalt also has the provision to add any custom scopes supported by the respective platform. Once the scopes has been added to the application in Cobalt, go to your Gong Developer Hub and update the scopes as added on Cobalt. Select the OAuth App created for Cobalt > Click on Edit option of the app > Add the scopes as added in Cobalt > Click on Save . If you are facing scopes missing or invalid scope error. Make sure you are not passing any custom scope not supported by the platform. And, the scopes selected here are identical to the ones selected in the platform. ​ Publishing Gong App While you’re creating your app, the app is set to Private by default, and can only be used by you in your Gong account. For the app to authenticate with your users, the app needs to be published.
