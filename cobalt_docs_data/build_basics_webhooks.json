A webhook is a method to provide external applications with real-time information about data changes in a platform. A webhook delivers data to the application at the moment that there is a change, resulting in data being pushed. Unlike REST APIs where the application polls the API at regular intervals in order to get the changed data. This makes webhooks much more efficient and friendly. ​ Event Types Currently Cobalt 5 webhook event types: Connection Created A connection is created { \"linked_account_id\" : \"12345\" , \"org_id\" : \"645270e37917442c4307297a\" , \"environment\" : \"test\" , \"type\" : \"General\" , \"event\" : \"Connection Created\" , \"slug\" : \"hubspot\" , \"createdAt\" : \"Tue, 07 Nov 2023 08:03:27 GMT\" } Connection Deleted A connection is deleted { \"linked_account_id\" : \"12345\" , \"org_id\" : \"645270e37917442c4307297a\" , \"environment\" : \"test\" , \"type\" : \"General\" , \"event\" : \"Connection Deleted\" , \"slug\" : \"hubspot\" , \"createdAt\" : \"Tue, 07 Nov 2023 08:04:27 GMT\" } Connection Expired A connection is removed or does not exist { \"linked_account_id\" : \"12345\" , \"org_id\" : \"645270e37917442c4307297a\" , \"environment\" : \"test\" , \"type\" : \"General\" , \"event\" : \"Connection Expired\" , \"slug\" : \"pipedrive\" , \"createdAt\" : \"Tue, 07 Nov 2023 08:38:33 GMT\" } Workflow Completed Workflow has been successfully executed { \"linked_account_id\" : \"12345\" , \"instance_id\" : \"656f30f69144bb8f183c0118\" , \"workflow_id\" : \"6495792b9b6ca6d77a17e513\" , \"config_id\" : \"12345\" , \"event\" : \"Workflow Completed\" , \"workflow_name\" : \"Export contact to Hubspot\" , \"status\" : \"COMPLETED\" } Workflow Errored Workflow execution stopped because of an error { \"linked_account_id\" : \"12345\" , \"instance_id\" : \"656f308b9144bb8f183bfc7b\" , \"workflow_id\" : \"6495792b9b6ca6d77a17e513\" , \"config_id\" : \"12345\" , \"event\" : \"Workflow Errored\" , \"workflow_name\" : \"Export contact to Hubspot\" , \"status\" : \"ERRORED\" } ​ How to subscribe to webhook events?
