After completing node-level testing, workflow tests allows users to assess the seamless execution of interconnected nodes, data flow, and overall workflow behavior. By simulating real-world scenarios and diverse payloads, users can ensure the reliability, scalability, and efficiency of their integrations. ​ Test Scenarios ​ 1. End-to-End Workflow Testing Validate the entire workflow from start to finish to ensure all nodes function correctly in sequence. Try executing the Workflow through the Try API section. Test scenarios include: Triggering the workflow with different input data or payload. Verifying the expected output at the end of the workflow. For eg: If the Workflow is supposed to create a New Contact on a successful execution, then check whether the Contact was created or not in the account. ​ 2. Error Handling Testing Evaluate the system’s response to errors and exceptions within the workflow. Test scenarios include: Introducing errors at different nodes to test error recovery mechanisms. Verifying error notifications and logging. ​ 3. Performance Testing Assess the performance and scalability of the workflow under varying load conditions. Test scenarios include: Simulating high-volume data processing. Monitoring response times and resource utilization. ​ 4. Integration Point Validation Verify the integration points with external systems and services for data exchange. Test scenarios include: Testing API integrations with different payloads. Validating data consistency across integrated systems. ​ Execution and Verification Process Follow the steps mentioned below to perform Orchestration testing in Cobalt: 1 Prepare Test Data Define test data and payloads in Events to simulate different scenarios. 2 Execute Workflow Tests Trigger the workflow with predefined test data through the Try API section to observe the behavior. 3 Monitor and Analyze Monitor the workflow execution, data flow, and system responses for anomalies. 4 Verify Results Compare the actual response with expected results to ensure the workflow functions as intended. To check the status of Workflow, navigate to Logs > Executions in Cobalt and check the workflow status. Learn more about Workflow logs here . 5 Iterate and Optimize Identify areas for improvement, optimize performance, and refine the workflow based on Logs obtained. ​ Checkpoint + Next Step You have now successfully verified and tested your workflows. It’s time to now make these orchestrations live for your users. Node Level Tests Handle ReAuth linkedin twitter Powered by Mintlify On this page Test Scenarios 1. End-to-End Workflow Testing 2.
