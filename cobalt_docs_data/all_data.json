Cobalt has over 100+ applications to integrate with, seamlessly. Cobalt lets your customers provide you with authorization to access their application platform. They do this by authenticating the application by providing the credentials such as an API key, a token or any other client credentials as required by the application platform, Or by OAuth mechanism. ​ OAuth mechanism Imagine borrowing a friend’s book from their bookshelf. You wouldn’t ask them to hand over the entire bookshelf and all their belongings, right? Instead, you’d simply ask for the specific book you need. OAuth works similarly, allowing secure access to specific resources on one platform without needing the user’s full credentials. Here’s how it works: You want to access a resource on another platform. You ask the user for permission to access that specific resource. The user logs in to the platform and grants you permission. The platform provides you with an access token, a temporary key, instead of your user’s entire login credentials. You use the access token to access the specific resource without needing the full login details. Benefits of OAuth: Increased security: No sharing of sensitive user credentials like passwords. Improved user experience: Seamless and secure authorization without requiring users to enter their credentials on multiple platforms. Wider reach: Enables developers to build apps that integrate with various platforms and services. Creating a developer app for OAuth is crucial because: It defines the scope of access your app needs: You specify which resources on the other platform your app wants to access e.g., read emails, manage contacts, etc. It establishes your app’s identity: The platform recognizes your app and grants access tokens accordingly. It enables secure communication: You receive secure credentials - access tokens to interact with the platform’s resources. Cobalt handles the API calls and Token management of all your application integrations. However, to create those tokens it is required that you create a developer app as it would provide the required client credentials to create the token. Here, we have brought together the developer app setup documentations of all the apps supported by Cobalt, with the primary focus on apps with OAuth setup. Need documentation for setup of a Cobalt supported integration? Please reach out with your request to our support team . Setup linkedin twitter Powered by Mintlify On this page OAuth mechanism"

Under the Setup tab, you will find the API Key in Overview section. You can copy the API key for either the Test environment or the Production environment . ​ Using Session Token for Authentication If you do not want to expose your API Key in the frontend implementation, you can also make the following API Calls by using a Session token in the Header instead of x-api-key and Linked-account-id : Config APIs Config Field APIs Refer here to understand how you can generate a Session Token for a Linked Account. ​ Rate Limits of Cobalt API Cobalt API has specific rate limits to ensure efficient and fair usage. Standard Rate Limit : 20 events per second. Burst Rate Limit : Allows a burst of 5 events in an instant within a second. ​ API Resources The Cobalt API includes several resources, each serving a specific purpose. Below is a brief description of each resource: Linked Account Linked Accounts refer to the end-users or customers of our users who utilize the integrations built using the Cobalt platform. Applications This resource refers to the integrations that the user has enabled in the Cobalt platform. Config This resource refers to the configs created in Cobalt for each integration. Event This resource refers to the events that are created in Cobalt and are used to trigger workflows in any integration. Webhooks Webhooks allow users subscribe to get real-time notifications when events occur in Cobalt. Executions This resource fetches the details of an execution in Cobalt. Session Token This resource is used to generate a session token to authenticate a linked account. Cobalt Hosted This resource is used to create hosted portal URLs or the properties saved against the session token. This overview provides the foundational knowledge needed to start working with Cobalt’s API. For more detailed information on each API endpoint, refer to the Cobalt API Reference.

Cobalt offers 200+ applications that can be connected for your customers to use across various segments such as Accounting , ATS , HRIS , CRM , Sales , Marketing and many more. Integrating with these platforms are pretty quick and seamless too using our Auth flow mechanisms. ​ Creating and launching Integrations The end customers can have access to apps enabled by the user. You just need to select from any of the available applications in the app section of the platform and enable it. However, for your end customer to connect with this plaform, provide authorization for their data to be accessed and for you to access their platform APIs, you need to follow the below steps: 1 Enable Integration Select the application and click on Go Live . 2 Configure Credentials In Settings section provide the required details under the Configure Credentials section. For API key auth based applications, no configuration is required on the Cobalt dashboard. You just need to enable the application. Your customer would provide the details in the auth flow portal. For OAuth based applications, you would need to provide credentials such as Client ID , Client Secret etc. or Cobalt offers the option to Use our credentials for playing around. To know how you setup an OAuth app for the integration, refer to Resources section. 3 Enable required permissions Make sure all the scopes mentioned under Permissions and scopes has been selected in the scopes panel in the developer account as well. You’re good to go! Your customer can now access the the application auth flow portal. Once the customer connects with the application by providing the API credentials or logging in to the application from the auth flow portal, they can see the defined settings and published workflows.

Workflows consist of Triggers and Actions , allowing for seamless automation and data flow between applications. With Workflows, users can easily implement common integration use cases such as pushing data from their application to users’ apps, receiving real-time updates through webhooks, and enabling non-technical teams to configure integrations without coding. Here are some examples of Workflows for popular integrations: Slack Send notifications from your application to Slack channels. Salesforce Sync contacts from your application to Salesforce CRM. HubSpot Sync contacts between HubSpot and your application. Google Calendar Create events in Google Calendar based on events in your application. The Workflow Builder simplifies the integration process, empowering developers to create seamless and efficient data flows between applications with ease. ​ Triggers All workflows start with a trigger , which determines when the workflow will run and how data is passed into the workflow. Triggers are setup in the Start Node of workflow. Available workflow trigger types include: App Events App Events are custom events that are sent from your application via the Cobalt SDK or API to trigger Workflows. In general, App Events are useful for triggering workflows that map data from your application to your users’ apps. For example, you might send a Contact Created App Event from your application to trigger a Workflow that creates a matching contact in your users’ Salesforce CRM. An App Event can be used to trigger multiple workflows. This is useful in cases where you may want the same event to trigger similar workflows across different integrations. Learn more about Events in our guide here . Default App Triggers Default App triggers can be used to run workflows based on events in your users’ apps. For example, you might want to trigger a workflow whenever new contacts are created in your users’ Salesforce account, to sync contacts to your application in real-time. Schedule The Scheduler trigger is used for workflows that should run automatically at a scheduled time or interval. Minutes (e.g. every 30 minutes) Hourly (e.g. every hour at 15 minutes past the hour) Daily (e.g. every 2 days at 9:00 am) The minimum time that can be set in scheduler should be greater than 5 minutes. Once deployed, the workflow will run automatically at the designated time for all users who have activated the workflow. Workflow API The Workflow API in Cobalt allows users to execute workflows programmatically instead of relying on event-based triggers. This API-based execution provides flexibility in triggering workflows directly through an API call. Know more about Workflow API here . ​ Actions Workflow actions helps you to create complex workflows. You can drag and drop them on the workflow canvas as nodes of a workflow, inter-connect and configure them to achieve required flow. These actions can be broadly categorized as: Cobalt's Native actions These actions do not make any API calls themselves but help as utility tools for making workflows. There are various nodes currently provided by Cobalt. You can learn more about any of the node by clicking on its card below. Custom Code This action takes input parameters and uses them to manipulate the data using custom code. Delay Delay allows you to pause the execution of next step till a certain time. Group This action is used to loop over an entity or a flow for a number of iterations. HTTP HTTP Node allows you to create an HTTP Request to any API of the integration. Merge The Merge Node allows you to merge multiple branches of a workflow into a single flow. PDF PDF node helps you to convert HTML to a PDF. Response Response node lets you notify you about the Subscribed Webhook events and define the data that needs to be sent to you along with the notification. Rule You can add conditional logic to workflows using our rule node. Send Email Send Email node lets you send an email through the workflow. Tables Tables node helps you create variables at runtime and add values to them. Transform This node lets you transform complex JSON into an easily accessible format. Cobalt's custom actions You can create Custom actions or API Proxies of your organization to use, in the Developer settings. Third party application actions Cobalt supports 100+ third party applications on its platform. Users can connect to these applications through Cobalt to make use of their APIs. When you select an application from the Apps list to create a workflow, you can find it’s Native node in the right panel along with the other actions. Drag and drop it on the workflow canvas to make use of the the application’s APIs supported by Cobalt. HTTP Request Users can also make any custom API call to the selected application that is not available with Cobalt as an action using the HTTP request. Simply setup the API in the node with all the required params like Method , URL , Request Body etc. and you are good to go.

Follow these simple steps to implement Cobalt. Sign up for a free account to receive your credentials and API Keys and understand how Cobalt simplifies building integrations for you. Integrate Cobalt Connect into your frontend. (Cobalt Connect is the user inferface that allows your customers to safely and securely grant your application access to their account.) You can opt to redirect to Cobalt Hosted Flow or build your own UI using Cobalt SDKs. Integrate the Cobalt API or SDK into your application’s backend. Read and Write Data to Third-party Apps from Cobalt. Optimize and test your application and workflows to maintain a smooth user experience using Cobalt. Once your integration has been tested thoroughly, go live with all of your customers. So let’s get started!! Create your account now. ​ Frontend + Backend For a full implementation, Cobalt requires both a frontend and a backend application to exist. The frontend application coordinates connecting the user with various integrations, and the backend server securely manages the requests and responses to and from Cobalt APIs. ​ Frontend Development Cobalt Auth flows lets your users connect their integration accounts. It stores the credentials securely and lets you make authorized API calls on your users’ behalf (linked account in Cobalt). There are three ways to integrate Cobalt into your application’s frontend user interface. Hosted flow : In this method you can effortlessly redirect your users’ to Cobalt Connect, which is securely hosted by Cobalt. Embedded flow : It is a good option if you want your client team to be responsible for the integration of Cobalt Connect into your app. You can use the Cobalt Connect JavaScript SDK or the Cobalt Connect React SDK to build your own custom UI for Cobalt Connect. Both SDKs make it easy to let your users authorize and manage integrations with just a few lines of code. Seamless flow : If you want your backend team to handle the integration, you can use the Connect API directly to create your own integration experience inside your app. ​ Backend Development Once the connection has been created via Cobalt frontend, you can now implement .connect() and .disconnect() function of Cobalt Client-side SDK to allow your end-users to make or break a connection with the integrations. We offer NodeJS backend SDKs to make the backend integration smoother.

This API-based execution provides flexibility in triggering workflows directly through an API call. ​ Setting up Workflow API as Trigger Let’s first see how you can setup a Workflow API for any of the workflows that you have in Cobalt. To set up a workflow to be triggered via the Workflow API: 1 Navigation Navigate to the Start Node of the workflow. 2 Setup Workflow API In the Start Node, select the API Call as the trigger method, make the required changes and click on Save . The API Call setup involves three fields: Workflow Alias (Optional) : This allows you to set a unique identifier for the workflow trigger. If used, this alias can replace the workflow ID in the API endpoint for executing the workflow. URL : The URL contains the endpoint for triggering the workflow. The format for this URL is . If you’ve set up a Workflow Alias, it can be used in place of the Workflow ID after /workflow/. Payload : Here, you define the JSON object or payload that contains the event data you want to send to the workflow. The variables set in the payload can be accessed within the workflow just like event payloads. You can leave this field as an empty object if no data needs to be passed. ​ Workflow API endpoints There are two APIs related to workflow execution: the /execute API and the /response API . ​ /execute API To execute a workflow, make a POST request to the workflow execution endpoint. If a Workflow Alias has been defined, you can replace workflow_id with the alias in the API. Send the event data in the request body, similar to how you would handle event payloads. If there is no payload, you can pass an empty JSON object . Request Headers linked_account_id : The Linked account for which you want to execute the workflow. Using Workflow API, the workflow gets executed even for those Linked Accounts who have not enabled the workflow. slug : Slug of the integration in which workflow is present. x-api-key : Your Cobalt API key sync_execution : By default, this is set to false , which means the API response will only include the execution_id . If you set sync_execution to true , the API response will include both the execution_id and the return_value object containing response as set in the Response node. sync_execution = true is not allowed if the workflow contains a Group Node. Sample cURL for Workflow Execute API: cURL curl --location --request POST 'https://api.gocobalt.io/api/v1/workflow/{workflow_id or alias}/execute' \\ --header 'content-type: application/json' \\ --header 'linked_account_id: john@acme.io' \\ --header 'slug: asana' \\ --header 'x-api-key: tkb5b9f358-4160-4fea-a926-cf52b271489d' \\ --header 'sync_execution: false' \\ --data ' { \"Task Name\" : \"Sample task\" , \"Created_at\" : \"2024-2-1\" , \"Assigned_to\" : \"John Doe\" } ' Response 200 { \"return_value\" : { \"success\" : \"true\" , \"new_note\" : \"This is the updated note content\" } , \"execution_id\" : \"66e404464f475f36c0c95b5d\" } If sync_execution is set to true and any node has Skip Node on Error enabled, then Node Retry for that node is not allowed in case of a workflow error. ​ /response API To fetch the response received in a previously executed workflow, use the following API. Request Headers linked_account_id : The Linked account for which the workflow was executed. x-api-key : Your Cobalt API key Sample cURL for Execution Response API: cURL curl --location --request GET 'https://api.gocobalt.io/api/v1/execution/{execution_id}/response' \\ --header 'linked_account_id: john@acme.io' \\ --header 'x-api-key: tkb5b9f358-4160-4fea-a926-cf52b271489d' Response The API response will include the data set in the workflow’s Response node, as well as the status of the workflow, which can be one of the following: COMPLETED: The workflow has successfully finished. RUNNING: The workflow is still in progress. ERRORED: The workflow encountered an error. 200 { \"response\" : { \"success\" : \"true\" , \"new_note\" : \"This is the updated note content\" } , \"status\" : \"COMPLETED\" } Overview Workflow Testing linkedin twitter Powered by Mintlify On this page Setting up Workflow API as Trigger Workflow API endpoints /execute API /response API"

This section of Cobalt’s platform is dedicated to setup the default application settings which would be useful in other Cobalt’s core functionalities, such as triggering an event, or calling a custom action. You can easily create common Events to trigger workflows or define a custom Action api setup to fire when required. ​ Setting up default authentication If your API are API key based, you can easily set the API keys for each linked account while creating them. Everytime the associated action is fired, the credentials will be set in the headers by default. Use this API reference for a detailed understanding. However if your api authentication is a bit more complex, such as getting a token using other credentials and using it for the authorization, Cobalt grants this provision as well. To do so first save the required data specific to the auth mechanism as UDF parameters, for example: Base URL , Region , API Key , API Secret etc; ​ Authentication Here, you can configure the API call to be made to fetch an access token each time before an action defined by you is to be executed. The below example describes setting up an api call using the base_url , access_key and secret as linked account variables. These values needs to be first set as UDF parameters while the linked account is being created. Check out this API reference for details. Here, the user is making a POST request to its server path /auth with api-key api-secret & Content-Type as header parameters. We expect as token object in return. ​ Injection details we get the token response from the above api call in the following fashion: { \"id\" : \"cfa64467-87be-4ef6-9cac-78477d77457c\" , \"token\" : \"<access token generated using credentials>\" , \"label\" : \"Access Token\" } Upon receiving the token object in response, we need to define where to set it while making an API call to the server. This can be achieved in this section. In the below example we are setting the token as a header parameter for any forthcoming API calls to the server via the default application’s actions.

Workflows consist of Triggers and Actions , allowing for seamless automation and data flow between applications. With Workflows, users can easily implement common integration use cases such as pushing data from their application to users’ apps, receiving real-time updates through webhooks, and enabling non-technical teams to configure integrations without coding. Here are some examples of Workflows for popular integrations: Slack Send notifications from your application to Slack channels. Salesforce Sync contacts from your application to Salesforce CRM. HubSpot Sync contacts between HubSpot and your application. Google Calendar Create events in Google Calendar based on events in your application. The Workflow Builder simplifies the integration process, empowering developers to create seamless and efficient data flows between applications with ease. ​ Triggers All workflows start with a trigger , which determines when the workflow will run and how data is passed into the workflow. Triggers are setup in the Start Node of workflow. Available workflow trigger types include: App Events App Events are custom events that are sent from your application via the Cobalt SDK or API to trigger Workflows. In general, App Events are useful for triggering workflows that map data from your application to your users’ apps. For example, you might send a Contact Created App Event from your application to trigger a Workflow that creates a matching contact in your users’ Salesforce CRM. An App Event can be used to trigger multiple workflows. This is useful in cases where you may want the same event to trigger similar workflows across different integrations. Learn more about Events in our guide here . Default App Triggers Default App triggers can be used to run workflows based on events in your users’ apps. For example, you might want to trigger a workflow whenever new contacts are created in your users’ Salesforce account, to sync contacts to your application in real-time. Schedule The Scheduler trigger is used for workflows that should run automatically at a scheduled time or interval. Minutes (e.g. every 30 minutes) Hourly (e.g. every hour at 15 minutes past the hour) Daily (e.g. every 2 days at 9:00 am) The minimum time that can be set in scheduler should be greater than 5 minutes. Once deployed, the workflow will run automatically at the designated time for all users who have activated the workflow. Workflow API The Workflow API in Cobalt allows users to execute workflows programmatically instead of relying on event-based triggers. This API-based execution provides flexibility in triggering workflows directly through an API call. Know more about Workflow API here . ​ Actions Workflow actions helps you to create complex workflows. You can drag and drop them on the workflow canvas as nodes of a workflow, inter-connect and configure them to achieve required flow. These actions can be broadly categorized as: Cobalt's Native actions These actions do not make any API calls themselves but help as utility tools for making workflows. There are various nodes currently provided by Cobalt. You can learn more about any of the node by clicking on its card below. Custom Code This action takes input parameters and uses them to manipulate the data using custom code. Delay Delay allows you to pause the execution of next step till a certain time. Group This action is used to loop over an entity or a flow for a number of iterations. HTTP HTTP Node allows you to create an HTTP Request to any API of the integration. Merge The Merge Node allows you to merge multiple branches of a workflow into a single flow. PDF PDF node helps you to convert HTML to a PDF. Response Response node lets you notify you about the Subscribed Webhook events and define the data that needs to be sent to you along with the notification. Rule You can add conditional logic to workflows using our rule node. Send Email Send Email node lets you send an email through the workflow. Tables Tables node helps you create variables at runtime and add values to them. Transform This node lets you transform complex JSON into an easily accessible format. Cobalt's custom actions You can create Custom actions or API Proxies of your organization to use, in the Developer settings. Third party application actions Cobalt supports 100+ third party applications on its platform. Users can connect to these applications through Cobalt to make use of their APIs. When you select an application from the Apps list to create a workflow, you can find it’s Native node in the right panel along with the other actions. Drag and drop it on the workflow canvas to make use of the the application’s APIs supported by Cobalt. HTTP Request Users can also make any custom API call to the selected application that is not available with Cobalt as an action using the HTTP request. Simply setup the API in the node with all the required params like Method , URL , Request Body etc. and you are good to go.

Follow these simple steps to implement Cobalt. Sign up for a free account to receive your credentials and API Keys and understand how Cobalt simplifies building integrations for you. Integrate Cobalt Connect into your frontend. (Cobalt Connect is the user inferface that allows your customers to safely and securely grant your application access to their account.) You can opt to redirect to Cobalt Hosted Flow or build your own UI using Cobalt SDKs. Integrate the Cobalt API or SDK into your application’s backend. Read and Write Data to Third-party Apps from Cobalt. Optimize and test your application and workflows to maintain a smooth user experience using Cobalt. Once your integration has been tested thoroughly, go live with all of your customers. So let’s get started!! Create your account now. ​ Frontend + Backend For a full implementation, Cobalt requires both a frontend and a backend application to exist. The frontend application coordinates connecting the user with various integrations, and the backend server securely manages the requests and responses to and from Cobalt APIs. ​ Frontend Development Cobalt Auth flows lets your users connect their integration accounts. It stores the credentials securely and lets you make authorized API calls on your users’ behalf (linked account in Cobalt). There are three ways to integrate Cobalt into your application’s frontend user interface. Hosted flow : In this method you can effortlessly redirect your users’ to Cobalt Connect, which is securely hosted by Cobalt. Embedded flow : It is a good option if you want your client team to be responsible for the integration of Cobalt Connect into your app. You can use the Cobalt Connect JavaScript SDK or the Cobalt Connect React SDK to build your own custom UI for Cobalt Connect. Both SDKs make it easy to let your users authorize and manage integrations with just a few lines of code. Seamless flow : If you want your backend team to handle the integration, you can use the Connect API directly to create your own integration experience inside your app. ​ Backend Development Once the connection has been created via Cobalt frontend, you can now implement .connect() and .disconnect() function of Cobalt Client-side SDK to allow your end-users to make or break a connection with the integrations. We offer NodeJS backend SDKs to make the backend integration smoother.

Navigation Examples Build Salesforce Integration Documentation Implementation & Guides API Reference SDKs Resources Cobalt home page v2 Postman Get Your API Key Examples Implementation Guide Get Started Integrate Communicate Test Integration Additional Deploy Examples Build Salesforce Integration Build NetSuite Integration Build Workday Integration Solutions 2 Way Data Sync Data Import Push Data to External Connector Examples Build Salesforce Integration In this guide, we will walk through the essential steps required to build a Salesforce integration using the Cobalt platform. This process involves three major steps i.e. User Authentication with Salesforce, Creating Workflows and Using workflows for users. ​ Authenticating with Salesforce integration To get started, first you need to enable the Salesforce integration in your account and also setup some basic processes. 1 Enable the Salesforce App Step 1: Enable the Salesforce App After setting up your account, the next step is to enable the Salesforce app in your Cobalt account. Apps cannot be enabled using the API. You will need to enable the app through the UI. To enable the Salesforce app: Navigate to Apps in Cobalt and search for Salesforce and enable the app by clicking on the Go Live button in the top right corner. Now, go to Settings and provide the Client ID and Client Secret of your Salesforce OAuth app and click on Save . Follow the steps given here to get your credentials. Once the app is enabled, you can proceed to create and manage workflows and linked accounts associated with Salesforce. 2 Create a Linked Account Step 2: Create a Linked Account A Linked Account in Cobalt represents the end-users or customers who will use the integration through the platform. Each Linked Account requires a unique linked_account_id, which typically corresponds to an ID from your internal data model (e.g., a user or account ID). Learn more about Linked Accounts here . To upsert (create or update) a Linked Account, use the following API call: Param Required Type Description linked_account_id Mandatory String Unique customer identifier name Optional String Name of the customer You can check the Linked Accounts in your Cobalt account by navigating to the Linked Accounts section in the side menu. Once the Linked Account is successfully created or updated, it will be ready for authentication in the next step. 3 Generate Session Token for your Linked Account Step 3: Generate Token After creating a Linked Account, the next step is to generate a session token. Session tokens help protect your Cobalt API key and manage end-customer tokens more securely. To create a session token, use the following API call: This session token will be included in subsequent requests to Cobalt APIs to authenticate and authorize the actions. 4 Open Hosted Portal Auth Flow Step 4: Open Hosted Portal Auth Flow Next, you will need to generate a Hosted URL that your users will use to authenticate with Salesforce. Cobalt securely stores the credentials and handles API calls on behalf of your users. Use the following API call to generate the Hosted URL: The response will return a Hosted URL that your users can visit to authenticate and connect their Salesforce accounts. Hosted Portal is a no-code solution provided by Cobalt that removes the need to build your own UI for handling integration authentication and configuration. 5 Authenticate Using Hosted Portal Step 5: Perform OAuth Authentication Visit the Hosted URL provided in the API response. The Hosted Portal will display all the integrations you have enabled, including Salesforce. To authenticate: Navigate to the Salesforce integration in the portal. Click Connect to begin the authentication process and allow consent to permissions requested. After completing the flow, you will be redirected back to the Hosted Portal with a confirmation that the account is successfully connected. You have successfully authenticated with Salesforce integration. The next step is to create workflows for your use-case. ​ Creating Workflows in Salesforce There are 3 major categories of workflows that you can create in any integration. Data Import from Salesforce Sync data from Salesforce to your system. Push Data to Salesforce Create data on Salesforce from your system. 2-way sync between Salesforce and you Keep the data between Salesforce and your system in sync. Let’s look at a sample workflow for each case. ​ Data Import from Salesforce Consider a use-case where you want to sync all the opportunities present in Salesforce to your system. In the Salesforce integration, go to Workflows and create a new workflow by clicking on +Add Workflow button and name it as Sync Opportunities . Data Import from Salesforce Follow the steps given to build the workflow: 1 Add Trigger in Start Node All workflows start with a trigger, which determines when the workflow will run and how data is passed into the workflow. For this workflow we will use the Event Based trigger. Learn more about the triggers and its types here . Click on the Start Node , select your native app option and click on + Create New Event . Give a name to your event and keep the payload as an empty object. 2 Add Salesforce Node Now to fetch all the opportunities present in your user’s account, we need to call Salesforce API. Click on Nodes option in the top right and drag the Salesforce Node from Native Apps section to the workflow builder. Connect this node with Start Node. 3 Fetch Opportunities from Salesforce using Action Click on the Salesforce Node and select Get Entity with SOQL action. Add the following under SOQL query field and click on Save . SELECT Id,Amount,AccountId, CloseDate,ContactId,Description,ExpectedRevenue,LeadSource, Name, OwnerId, Probability,StageName,Type FROM Opportunity You can provide any additonal fields that you want to fetch about opportunities from Salesforce by adding it to this query. 4 Add Custom Code node We have fetched all the opportunities, but you might require to structure it as a payload which your platform can receive. Let’s do this using Custom Code node. Drag the Custom Code from the Utility Nodes section onto the workflow builder and connect it with Salesforce node. 5 Mapping Opportunity fields Click on + Map Fields under Input Parameters, add key name as deals and in value we will provide the response received through Salesforce node which will be restructured. In Value , select Nodes tab under Insert Variable and click on + of the Salesforce Node. You can now do mapping using JavaScript code. Try the sample code provided below: function yourFunction(params) { const res = params.deals.map(ele=>{ const output = { id: ele.Id, title: ele.Name, description: ele.Description || 'Description not available', close_date: ele.CloseDate, amount: ele.Amount, expected_revenue: ele.ExpectedRevenue, status: ele.StageName } return output }) return {\"result\": res || [] } } 6 API Proxy in Workflow You have successfully fetched all opportunities and structured the payload. Now to receive it in your server, you need to configure an API Proxy. In Cobalt Dashboard, navigate to Developer > API Proxies and click on New Action . Configure an API endpoint, where you want to receive the response. If you want to test, go to webhook.site and copy Your unique URL and configure this as a POST Request and Save . Learn more about API Proxies here . 7 Use API Proxy in Workflow From Native Apps nodes, add your org’s Node and connect it with Custom Code. Click on the node and select the API Proxy that you created from the Actions. Add the response from Custom Code node in data field and click on Save . Ensure that you add a field in the API Proxy where you can pass the JSON data and then added it to the API Call body as well in the POST request. Hurray!! You have successfully created a Salesforce workflow to sync all the opportunities to your system. ​ Push Data to Salesforce Consider a use-case where you want to create a contact present in your system to Salesforce. This workflow will be fired when you send an Event with the payload of the contact to be added. In the Salesforce integration, go to Workflows and create a new workflow by clicking on +Add Workflow button and name it as Create New Contact . Push Data to Salesforce Follow the steps given to build the workflow: 1 Add Trigger in Start Node All workflows start with a trigger, which determines when the workflow will run and how data is passed into the workflow. For this workflow we will use the Event Based trigger. Learn more about the triggers and its types here . Click on the Start Node , select your native app option and click on + Create New Event . Give a name to your event and provide all the data related to the contact in the payload. 2 Add Salesforce Node Now to create a new contact in Salesforce, we need to call Salesforce API. Click on Nodes option in the top right and drag the Salesforce Node from Native Apps section to the workflow builder. Connect this node with Start Node. 3 Add Action in node Click on Salesforce Node and add the Create Contact action. To provide the data in all the fields from your Event payload, just click on a field and from the Event tab under Insert Variable, select the fields from the body that you sent as payload. Ensure that all the mandatory fields in the action are filled, else the Salesforce API will give error. Hurray!! You have successfully created a Salesforce workflow to create a new contact. ​ 2-way sync between Salesforce and you (Webhooks) For bi-directional sync, usually three workflows are required: Workflow for Initial sync where all the records are fetched from Salesforce. This is the same workflow as Data Import workflow that we created here . Workflow to push record in Salesforce when a new record is created on your platform. We created this workflow of Push Data here . Workflow to update records in your system whenever a contact gets created or updated in Salesforce. Update records workflow To perform a real time update whenever a change happens in Salesforce, we will use Salesforce Webhook as a trigger for our workflow. Follow the steps given below to setup your workflow: 1 Add Salesforce Webhook as trigger In the Start Node, select Salesforce as the trigger and select Contact Created event. Similarly, you can use the Contact Updated event to get notified whenever a contact is updated in Salesforce. By using the Contact Created trigger, you will receive data as an event payload about any new contact created in Salesforce in real time. 2 Send New Contact data to your system Send the data that we received about the new contact to your system to perform real time sync. From Native Apps nodes, add your org’s Node and connect it with Start Node. Click on the node and select the API Proxy that you created from the Actions to receive new contact info. Add the response from Event using Insert Variables and click on Save . Ensure that you add a field in the API Proxy where you can pass the data and then added it to the API Call body as well in the POST request. Hurray! You have successfully created a workflow which will inform you whenever a new contact is created in Salesforce. You have successfully created the workflows for your use case. Next step is to enable and execute those workflows for your Linked Accounts. ​ Executing the Workflows To run these workflows for your users or Linked Accounts, you need to do the following steps: 1 Create Config for Linked Account Config is a customization that you store for each integration of your end-customers. Create Config You can create config for the Linked Account through the Cobalt Connect SDKs or using the APIs. You can use the .config() method or the Create Config API which returns the specified config or creates one if it doesn’t exist for the Linked Account. Make a request with the Application Slug and linked_account_id as mandatory fields for it. You can request in the following way: It will return information about config of the application for the Linked Account and provides you with all the published workflows and settings input for the user required to execute the workflow. Response { \"slug\" : \"salesforce\" , \"config_id\" : \"OPTIONAL_ID_FOR_THIS_CONFIG\" , \"fields\" : [ ] , \"workflows\" : [ { \"id\" : \"64d1fac58716dc5065127ffe\" , \"name\" : \"Sync Opportunities\" , \"description\" : \"\" , \"enabled\" : false , \"fields\" : [ ] } ] , \"field_errors\" : [ ] } 2 Enable Workflow Now you need to enable the workflow for your Linked account. You can either ask the user to enable them or you can do so for them by using the Update Config API or .updateconfig() method. Make the following request: In response, you get the updated config information for the application. 3 Third Step Once the required workflows are enabled, you need to fire event to start execution. You can use the Trigger Event for app API with the following request: cURL curl -- request POST \\ -- url https : / / api . gocobalt . io / api / v2 / public / event / : slug \\ -- header 'Content-Type: application/json' \\ -- header 'linked_account_id: <linked_account_id>' \\ -- header 'x-api-key: <api-key>' \\ -- data ' { \"event\" : \"<string>\" , \"payload\" : { } } ' 4 Check Execution Logs Once the workflow execution has been fired, you can check the Logs of the workflow here . Learn more about logs and observability here . Congratulations!! You have successfully created a Salesforce integration and executed it for your users.

Workflows consist of Triggers and Actions , allowing for seamless automation and data flow between applications. With Workflows, users can easily implement common integration use cases such as pushing data from their application to users’ apps, receiving real-time updates through webhooks, and enabling non-technical teams to configure integrations without coding. Here are some examples of Workflows for popular integrations: Slack Send notifications from your application to Slack channels. Salesforce Sync contacts from your application to Salesforce CRM. HubSpot Sync contacts between HubSpot and your application. Google Calendar Create events in Google Calendar based on events in your application. The Workflow Builder simplifies the integration process, empowering developers to create seamless and efficient data flows between applications with ease. ​ Triggers All workflows start with a trigger , which determines when the workflow will run and how data is passed into the workflow. Triggers are setup in the Start Node of workflow. Available workflow trigger types include: App Events App Events are custom events that are sent from your application via the Cobalt SDK or API to trigger Workflows. In general, App Events are useful for triggering workflows that map data from your application to your users’ apps. For example, you might send a Contact Created App Event from your application to trigger a Workflow that creates a matching contact in your users’ Salesforce CRM. An App Event can be used to trigger multiple workflows. This is useful in cases where you may want the same event to trigger similar workflows across different integrations. Learn more about Events in our guide here . Default App Triggers Default App triggers can be used to run workflows based on events in your users’ apps. For example, you might want to trigger a workflow whenever new contacts are created in your users’ Salesforce account, to sync contacts to your application in real-time. Schedule The Scheduler trigger is used for workflows that should run automatically at a scheduled time or interval. Minutes (e.g. every 30 minutes) Hourly (e.g. every hour at 15 minutes past the hour) Daily (e.g. every 2 days at 9:00 am) The minimum time that can be set in scheduler should be greater than 5 minutes. Once deployed, the workflow will run automatically at the designated time for all users who have activated the workflow. Workflow API The Workflow API in Cobalt allows users to execute workflows programmatically instead of relying on event-based triggers. This API-based execution provides flexibility in triggering workflows directly through an API call. Know more about Workflow API here . ​ Actions Workflow actions helps you to create complex workflows. You can drag and drop them on the workflow canvas as nodes of a workflow, inter-connect and configure them to achieve required flow. These actions can be broadly categorized as: Cobalt's Native actions These actions do not make any API calls themselves but help as utility tools for making workflows. There are various nodes currently provided by Cobalt. You can learn more about any of the node by clicking on its card below. Custom Code This action takes input parameters and uses them to manipulate the data using custom code. Delay Delay allows you to pause the execution of next step till a certain time. Group This action is used to loop over an entity or a flow for a number of iterations. HTTP HTTP Node allows you to create an HTTP Request to any API of the integration. Merge The Merge Node allows you to merge multiple branches of a workflow into a single flow. PDF PDF node helps you to convert HTML to a PDF. Response Response node lets you notify you about the Subscribed Webhook events and define the data that needs to be sent to you along with the notification. Rule You can add conditional logic to workflows using our rule node. Send Email Send Email node lets you send an email through the workflow. Tables Tables node helps you create variables at runtime and add values to them. Transform This node lets you transform complex JSON into an easily accessible format. Cobalt's custom actions You can create Custom actions or API Proxies of your organization to use, in the Developer settings. Third party application actions Cobalt supports 100+ third party applications on its platform. Users can connect to these applications through Cobalt to make use of their APIs. When you select an application from the Apps list to create a workflow, you can find it’s Native node in the right panel along with the other actions. Drag and drop it on the workflow canvas to make use of the the application’s APIs supported by Cobalt. HTTP Request Users can also make any custom API call to the selected application that is not available with Cobalt as an action using the HTTP request. Simply setup the API in the node with all the required params like Method , URL , Request Body etc. and you are good to go.

By firing events from the Try API interface, users can verify the correctness and responsiveness of their workflows. The Try API feature can be utilized in both Production and Test environments, providing flexibility for testing and validation purposes. Events selected through the Try API interface can serve as triggers within workflows, enabling comprehensive testing of workflow execution and automation logic. The payload associated with the selected event is automatically loaded within the Try API interface, allowing users to make necessary modifications before firing the event. ​ Pre-Condition: Before utilizing the Try API feature, ensure that the Application is connected and configured properly. ​ Execution To fire an event in the Try API section, follow these steps: Navigate to the Application for which you want to create and test a workflow. Create a workflow and add an event along with associated actions. Publish the workflow to make it available for execution. Learn more about how to create workflows here .

Navigation Examples Build Salesforce Integration Documentation Implementation & Guides API Reference SDKs Resources Cobalt home page v2 Postman Get Your API Key Examples Implementation Guide Get Started Integrate Communicate Test Integration Additional Deploy Examples Build Salesforce Integration Build NetSuite Integration Build Workday Integration Solutions 2 Way Data Sync Data Import Push Data to External Connector Examples Build Salesforce Integration In this guide, we will walk through the essential steps required to build a Salesforce integration using the Cobalt platform. This process involves three major steps i.e. User Authentication with Salesforce, Creating Workflows and Using workflows for users. ​ Authenticating with Salesforce integration To get started, first you need to enable the Salesforce integration in your account and also setup some basic processes. 1 Enable the Salesforce App Step 1: Enable the Salesforce App After setting up your account, the next step is to enable the Salesforce app in your Cobalt account. Apps cannot be enabled using the API. You will need to enable the app through the UI. To enable the Salesforce app: Navigate to Apps in Cobalt and search for Salesforce and enable the app by clicking on the Go Live button in the top right corner. Now, go to Settings and provide the Client ID and Client Secret of your Salesforce OAuth app and click on Save . Follow the steps given here to get your credentials. Once the app is enabled, you can proceed to create and manage workflows and linked accounts associated with Salesforce. 2 Create a Linked Account Step 2: Create a Linked Account A Linked Account in Cobalt represents the end-users or customers who will use the integration through the platform. Each Linked Account requires a unique linked_account_id, which typically corresponds to an ID from your internal data model (e.g., a user or account ID). Learn more about Linked Accounts here . To upsert (create or update) a Linked Account, use the following API call: Param Required Type Description linked_account_id Mandatory String Unique customer identifier name Optional String Name of the customer You can check the Linked Accounts in your Cobalt account by navigating to the Linked Accounts section in the side menu. Once the Linked Account is successfully created or updated, it will be ready for authentication in the next step. 3 Generate Session Token for your Linked Account Step 3: Generate Token After creating a Linked Account, the next step is to generate a session token. Session tokens help protect your Cobalt API key and manage end-customer tokens more securely. To create a session token, use the following API call: This session token will be included in subsequent requests to Cobalt APIs to authenticate and authorize the actions. 4 Open Hosted Portal Auth Flow Step 4: Open Hosted Portal Auth Flow Next, you will need to generate a Hosted URL that your users will use to authenticate with Salesforce. Cobalt securely stores the credentials and handles API calls on behalf of your users. Use the following API call to generate the Hosted URL: The response will return a Hosted URL that your users can visit to authenticate and connect their Salesforce accounts. Hosted Portal is a no-code solution provided by Cobalt that removes the need to build your own UI for handling integration authentication and configuration. 5 Authenticate Using Hosted Portal Step 5: Perform OAuth Authentication Visit the Hosted URL provided in the API response. The Hosted Portal will display all the integrations you have enabled, including Salesforce. To authenticate: Navigate to the Salesforce integration in the portal. Click Connect to begin the authentication process and allow consent to permissions requested. After completing the flow, you will be redirected back to the Hosted Portal with a confirmation that the account is successfully connected. You have successfully authenticated with Salesforce integration. The next step is to create workflows for your use-case. ​ Creating Workflows in Salesforce There are 3 major categories of workflows that you can create in any integration. Data Import from Salesforce Sync data from Salesforce to your system. Push Data to Salesforce Create data on Salesforce from your system. 2-way sync between Salesforce and you Keep the data between Salesforce and your system in sync. Let’s look at a sample workflow for each case. ​ Data Import from Salesforce Consider a use-case where you want to sync all the opportunities present in Salesforce to your system. In the Salesforce integration, go to Workflows and create a new workflow by clicking on +Add Workflow button and name it as Sync Opportunities . Data Import from Salesforce Follow the steps given to build the workflow: 1 Add Trigger in Start Node All workflows start with a trigger, which determines when the workflow will run and how data is passed into the workflow. For this workflow we will use the Event Based trigger. Learn more about the triggers and its types here . Click on the Start Node , select your native app option and click on + Create New Event . Give a name to your event and keep the payload as an empty object. 2 Add Salesforce Node Now to fetch all the opportunities present in your user’s account, we need to call Salesforce API. Click on Nodes option in the top right and drag the Salesforce Node from Native Apps section to the workflow builder. Connect this node with Start Node. 3 Fetch Opportunities from Salesforce using Action Click on the Salesforce Node and select Get Entity with SOQL action. Add the following under SOQL query field and click on Save . SELECT Id,Amount,AccountId, CloseDate,ContactId,Description,ExpectedRevenue,LeadSource, Name, OwnerId, Probability,StageName,Type FROM Opportunity You can provide any additonal fields that you want to fetch about opportunities from Salesforce by adding it to this query. 4 Add Custom Code node We have fetched all the opportunities, but you might require to structure it as a payload which your platform can receive. Let’s do this using Custom Code node. Drag the Custom Code from the Utility Nodes section onto the workflow builder and connect it with Salesforce node. 5 Mapping Opportunity fields Click on + Map Fields under Input Parameters, add key name as deals and in value we will provide the response received through Salesforce node which will be restructured. In Value , select Nodes tab under Insert Variable and click on + of the Salesforce Node. You can now do mapping using JavaScript code. Try the sample code provided below: function yourFunction(params) { const res = params.deals.map(ele=>{ const output = { id: ele.Id, title: ele.Name, description: ele.Description || 'Description not available', close_date: ele.CloseDate, amount: ele.Amount, expected_revenue: ele.ExpectedRevenue, status: ele.StageName } return output }) return {\"result\": res || [] } } 6 API Proxy in Workflow You have successfully fetched all opportunities and structured the payload. Now to receive it in your server, you need to configure an API Proxy. In Cobalt Dashboard, navigate to Developer > API Proxies and click on New Action . Configure an API endpoint, where you want to receive the response. If you want to test, go to webhook.site and copy Your unique URL and configure this as a POST Request and Save . Learn more about API Proxies here . 7 Use API Proxy in Workflow From Native Apps nodes, add your org’s Node and connect it with Custom Code. Click on the node and select the API Proxy that you created from the Actions. Add the response from Custom Code node in data field and click on Save . Ensure that you add a field in the API Proxy where you can pass the JSON data and then added it to the API Call body as well in the POST request. Hurray!! You have successfully created a Salesforce workflow to sync all the opportunities to your system. ​ Push Data to Salesforce Consider a use-case where you want to create a contact present in your system to Salesforce. This workflow will be fired when you send an Event with the payload of the contact to be added. In the Salesforce integration, go to Workflows and create a new workflow by clicking on +Add Workflow button and name it as Create New Contact . Push Data to Salesforce Follow the steps given to build the workflow: 1 Add Trigger in Start Node All workflows start with a trigger, which determines when the workflow will run and how data is passed into the workflow. For this workflow we will use the Event Based trigger. Learn more about the triggers and its types here . Click on the Start Node , select your native app option and click on + Create New Event . Give a name to your event and provide all the data related to the contact in the payload. 2 Add Salesforce Node Now to create a new contact in Salesforce, we need to call Salesforce API. Click on Nodes option in the top right and drag the Salesforce Node from Native Apps section to the workflow builder. Connect this node with Start Node. 3 Add Action in node Click on Salesforce Node and add the Create Contact action. To provide the data in all the fields from your Event payload, just click on a field and from the Event tab under Insert Variable, select the fields from the body that you sent as payload. Ensure that all the mandatory fields in the action are filled, else the Salesforce API will give error. Hurray!! You have successfully created a Salesforce workflow to create a new contact. ​ 2-way sync between Salesforce and you (Webhooks) For bi-directional sync, usually three workflows are required: Workflow for Initial sync where all the records are fetched from Salesforce. This is the same workflow as Data Import workflow that we created here . Workflow to push record in Salesforce when a new record is created on your platform. We created this workflow of Push Data here . Workflow to update records in your system whenever a contact gets created or updated in Salesforce. Update records workflow To perform a real time update whenever a change happens in Salesforce, we will use Salesforce Webhook as a trigger for our workflow. Follow the steps given below to setup your workflow: 1 Add Salesforce Webhook as trigger In the Start Node, select Salesforce as the trigger and select Contact Created event. Similarly, you can use the Contact Updated event to get notified whenever a contact is updated in Salesforce. By using the Contact Created trigger, you will receive data as an event payload about any new contact created in Salesforce in real time. 2 Send New Contact data to your system Send the data that we received about the new contact to your system to perform real time sync. From Native Apps nodes, add your org’s Node and connect it with Start Node. Click on the node and select the API Proxy that you created from the Actions to receive new contact info. Add the response from Event using Insert Variables and click on Save . Ensure that you add a field in the API Proxy where you can pass the data and then added it to the API Call body as well in the POST request. Hurray! You have successfully created a workflow which will inform you whenever a new contact is created in Salesforce. You have successfully created the workflows for your use case. Next step is to enable and execute those workflows for your Linked Accounts. ​ Executing the Workflows To run these workflows for your users or Linked Accounts, you need to do the following steps: 1 Create Config for Linked Account Config is a customization that you store for each integration of your end-customers. Create Config You can create config for the Linked Account through the Cobalt Connect SDKs or using the APIs. You can use the .config() method or the Create Config API which returns the specified config or creates one if it doesn’t exist for the Linked Account. Make a request with the Application Slug and linked_account_id as mandatory fields for it. You can request in the following way: It will return information about config of the application for the Linked Account and provides you with all the published workflows and settings input for the user required to execute the workflow. Response { \"slug\" : \"salesforce\" , \"config_id\" : \"OPTIONAL_ID_FOR_THIS_CONFIG\" , \"fields\" : [ ] , \"workflows\" : [ { \"id\" : \"64d1fac58716dc5065127ffe\" , \"name\" : \"Sync Opportunities\" , \"description\" : \"\" , \"enabled\" : false , \"fields\" : [ ] } ] , \"field_errors\" : [ ] } 2 Enable Workflow Now you need to enable the workflow for your Linked account. You can either ask the user to enable them or you can do so for them by using the Update Config API or .updateconfig() method. Make the following request: In response, you get the updated config information for the application. 3 Third Step Once the required workflows are enabled, you need to fire event to start execution. You can use the Trigger Event for app API with the following request: cURL curl -- request POST \\ -- url https : / / api . gocobalt . io / api / v2 / public / event / : slug \\ -- header 'Content-Type: application/json' \\ -- header 'linked_account_id: <linked_account_id>' \\ -- header 'x-api-key: <api-key>' \\ -- data ' { \"event\" : \"<string>\" , \"payload\" : { } } ' 4 Check Execution Logs Once the workflow execution has been fired, you can check the Logs of the workflow here . Learn more about logs and observability here . Congratulations!! You have successfully created a Salesforce integration and executed it for your users.

Now that you have successfully created Linked Accounts for your end-users, it’s time to create Session Tokens for your clients. The token creation should always happen server side. Session tokens are used to protect your Cobalt API key and make it easier to manage your end customers’ tokens. When your client makes a request to the Cobalt APIs, it must include the session token in the request header. The Cobalt APIs will then use the session token to authenticate the request and grant access to the requested resources. To generate Session Token for a Linked Account, you can use the Cobalt API or Cobalt’s Client Side SDK. ​ Cobalt API/SDK for Session Token Request : In your server side code, make a POST Request to the /session-token endpoint or call the .getTokenForLinkedAccount() method of the NodeJS SDK . The request should include the linked-account_id of the user for which the Session token is to be generated. The session token gets expired in 24 hours. Please make sure you generate a new token in every new session or within 24 hours. Handle the response : Cobalt will respond with a JSON Object containing the token if request was successful. Parse the JSON response body and extract the token . Response { \"token\" : \"eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJvcmdfaWQiOiI2M2M5M2RhMGI0NmI3MjQzNzg1YTFlMTciLCJsaW5rZWRfYWNjb3VudF9pZCI6IjEyMzQ1Njc4IiwiZW52aXJvbm1lbnQiOiJ0ZXN0IiwiaWF0Ij\" } Store the Session token : It is critical to store Session tokens securely, as they grant access to sensitive user data. Implement a secure storage solution to store Session tokens and do not log or expose tokens to your frontend application. Handle Errors : If the /session-token endpoint returns a 500 error, your server-side code should handle it gracefully. The error is returned due to providing an incorrect linked_account_id while making the request. ​ Checkpoint + Next Step After completing this step, you now have the Session Token for your Linked Accounts. But before you make the API Calls, first let’s Display the apps/integrations on Client-side .

This process involves three major steps i.e. User Authentication with Workday, Creating Workflows and Using workflows for users. ​ Authenticating with Workday integration To get started, first you need to enable the Workday integration in your account and also setup some basic processes. 1 Enable the Workday App Step 1: Enable the Workday App After setting up your account, the next step is to enable the Workday app in your Cobalt account. Apps cannot be enabled using the API. You will need to enable the app through the UI. To enable the Workday app: Navigate to Apps in Cobalt and search for Workday and enable the app by clicking on the Go Live button in the top right corner. Since this is a API Key based app, you do not need to perform any setup for user authentication. Follow the steps given here to get your API credentials required for authentication. Once the app is enabled, you can proceed to create and manage workflows and linked accounts associated with Workday. 2 Create a Linked Account Step 2: Create a Linked Account A Linked Account in Cobalt represents the end-users or customers who will use the integration through the platform. Each Linked Account requires a unique linked_account_id, which typically corresponds to an ID from your internal data model (e.g., a user or account ID). Learn more about Linked Accounts here . To upsert (create or update) a Linked Account, use the following API call: Param Required Type Description linked_account_id Mandatory String Unique customer identifier name Optional String Name of the customer You can check the Linked Accounts in your Cobalt account by navigating to the Linked Accounts section in the side menu. Once the Linked Account is successfully created or updated, it will be ready for authentication in the next step. 3 Generate Session Token for your Linked Account Step 3: Generate Token After creating a Linked Account, the next step is to generate a session token. Session tokens help protect your Cobalt API key and manage end-customer tokens more securely. To create a session token, use the following API call: This session token will be included in subsequent requests to Cobalt APIs to authenticate and authorize the actions. 4 Open Hosted Portal Auth Flow Step 4: Open Hosted Portal Auth Flow Next, you will need to generate a Hosted URL that your users will use to authenticate with Salesforce. Cobalt securely stores the credentials and handles API calls on behalf of your users. Use the following API call to generate the Hosted URL: The response will return a Hosted URL that your users can visit to authenticate and connect their Salesforce accounts. Hosted Portal is a no-code solution provided by Cobalt that removes the need to build your own UI for handling integration authentication and configuration. 5 Authenticate Using Hosted Portal Step 5: Perform Key based Authentication Visit the Hosted URL provided in the API response. The Hosted Portal will display all the integrations you have enabled, including NetSuite. To authenticate: Navigate to the Workday integration in the portal. Provide the requested credentials. Click on Connect to begin successfully authenticate with Workday. You have successfully authenticated with Workday integration. The next step is to create workflows for your use-case. ​ Creating Workflows in Workday There are 2 major categories of workflows that you can create in Workday currently. Data Import from Workday Sync data from Workday to your system. Push Data to Workday Create data on Workday from your system. Let’s look at a sample workflow for each case. ​ Data Import from Workday Consider a use-case where you want to sync all the employees present in Workday to your system. In the Workday integration, go to Workflows and create a new workflow by clicking on +Add Workflow button and name it as Sync Employees . Data Import from Workday Follow the steps given to build the workflow: 1 Add Trigger in Start Node All workflows start with a trigger, which determines when the workflow will run and how data is passed into the workflow. For this workflow we will use the Event Based trigger. Learn more about the triggers and its types here . Click on the Start Node , select your native app option and click on + Create New Event . Give a name to your event and keep the payload as an empty object. 2 Add Workday Node Now to fetch all the employees present in your user’s account, we need to call Workday API. Click on Nodes option in the top right and drag the Workday Node from Native Apps section to the workflow builder. Connect this node with Start Node. 3 Fetch Employees from Workday using Action Click on the Workday Node and select Get Workers action. You can do additional filters in the Get Workers action such as exclude inactive workers and more. 4 Mapping Employee fields Click on + Map Fields under Input Parameters, add key name as employees and in value we will provide the response received through Workday node which will be restructured. In Value , select Nodes tab under Insert Variable and click on + of the Workday Node. You can now do mapping using JavaScript code. Try the sample code provided below: function yourFunction(params) { const data = params.employees return data[\"env:Envelope\"][\"env:Body\"][\"wd:Get_Workers_Response\"][\"wd:Response_Data\"][\"wd:Worker\"].map((workdata)=>{ return { first_name: workdata[\"wd:Worker_Descriptor\"].split(\" \")[0] ?? \"\", last_name: workdata[\"wd:Worker_Descriptor\"].split(\" \")[1] ?? \"\", display_name: workdata[\"wd:Worker_Descriptor\"], id: workdata[\"wd:Worker_Reference\"][\"wd:ID\"][0][\"_\"], primary_email: workdata[\"wd:Worker_Descriptor\"].split(\" \")[0] + '@workday.com' } }) } 5 API Proxy in Workflow You have successfully fetched all contacts and structured the payload. Now to receive it in your server, you need to configure an API Proxy. In Cobalt Dashboard, navigate to Developer > API Proxies and click on New Action . Configure an API endpoint, where you want to receive the response. If you want to test, go to webhook.site and copy Your unique URL and configure this as a POST Request and Save . Learn more about API Proxies here . 6 Use API Proxy in Workflow From Native Apps nodes, add your org’s Node and connect it with Custom Code. Click on the node and select the API Proxy that you created from the Actions. Add the response from Custom Code node in data field and click on Save . Ensure that you add a field in the API Proxy where you can pass the JSON data and then added it to the API Call body as well in the POST request. Hurray!! You have successfully created a Workday workflow to sync all the employees to your system. ​ Push Data to Workday Consider a use-case where you want to create an employee present in your system to Workday. This workflow will be fired when you send an Event with the payload of the contact to be added. In the Workday integration, go to Workflows and create a new workflow by clicking on +Add Workflow button and name it as Create New Employee . Push Data to Workday Follow the steps given to build the workflow: 1 Add Trigger in Start Node All workflows start with a trigger, which determines when the workflow will run and how data is passed into the workflow. For this workflow we will use the Event Based trigger. Learn more about the triggers and its types here . Click on the Start Node , select your native app option and click on + Create New Event . Give a name to your event and provide all the data related to the contact in the payload. 2 Add Workday Node Now to create a new contact in Workday, we need to call Workday API. Click on Nodes option in the top right and drag the Workday Node from Native Apps section to the workflow builder. Connect this node with Start Node. 3 Add Action in node Click on Workday Node and add the Create Employee action. To provide the data in all the fields from your Event payload, just click on a field and from the Event tab under Insert Variable, select the fields from the body that you sent as payload. Ensure that all the mandatory fields in the action are filled, else the Workday API will give error. Hurray!! You have successfully created a Workday workflow to create a new employee. You have successfully created the workflows for your use case. Next step is to enable and execute those workflows for your Linked Accounts. ​ Executing the Workflows To run these workflows for your users or Linked Accounts, you need to do the following steps: 1 Create Config for Linked Account Config is a customization that you store for each integration of your end-customers. Create Config You can create config for the Linked Account through the Cobalt Connect SDKs or using the APIs. You can use the .config() method or the Create Config API which returns the specified config or creates one if it doesn’t exist for the Linked Account. Make a request with the Application Slug and linked_account_id as mandatory fields for it. You can request in the following way: It will return information about config of the application for the Linked Account and provides you with all the published workflows and settings input for the user required to execute the workflow. Response { \"slug\" : \"workday\" , \"config_id\" : \"OPTIONAL_ID_FOR_THIS_CONFIG\" , \"fields\" : [ ] , \"workflows\" : [ { \"id\" : \"64d1fac58716dc5065127ffe\" , \"name\" : \"Sync Employees\" , \"description\" : \"\" , \"enabled\" : false , \"fields\" : [ ] } ] , \"field_errors\" : [ ] } 2 Enable Workflow Now you need to enable the workflow for your Linked account. You can either ask the user to enable them or you can do so for them by using the Update Config API or .updateconfig() method. Make the following request: In response, you get the updated config information for the application. 3 Third Step Once the required workflows are enabled, you need to fire event to start execution. You can use the Trigger Event for app API with the following request: cURL curl -- request POST \\ -- url https : / / api . gocobalt . io / api / v2 / public / event / : slug \\ -- header 'Content-Type: application/json' \\ -- header 'linked_account_id: <linked_account_id>' \\ -- header 'x-api-key: <api-key>' \\ -- data ' { \"event\" : \"<string>\" , \"payload\" : { } } ' 4 Check Execution Logs Once the workflow execution has been fired, you can check the Logs of the workflow here . Learn more about logs and observability here . Congratulations!! You have successfully created a Workday integration and executed it for your users.

If you want to learn about JSONata expression, refer here . ​ Input Fields The Transform node offers two input fields: Please note that both the input and query fields are required for the Transform node to function properly. ​ Input This field accepts a JSON object, where the Array needs to be given and can be selected from a DataSlot or a previous Node in the workflow. It serves as the input data for transformation. The format of the Input can be in the format: { \"input\" : \"{Array_name}\" // When you have the Array \"input\" : \"{{Node_name: data}}\" // When you want to fetch response of a previous node. // The Node_name is selected by using Nodes in Variables // \"input\" and \"data\" key can be replaced by any other word like result etc. } ​ Query In this field, users need to provide a valid JSONata expression to query or transform the input object. The expression structure in Query is given below. { \"output\" : \"JSONata expression\" // The key should be \"output\" in Query field. } If only the JSONata expression is provided in Query field rather than an object, then the node will give an empty response and result cannot be used in further nodes of the Workflow. By leveraging the Transform node in Cobalt workflows, users can efficiently process and manipulate JSON data. Whether extracting specific information or performing complex transformations, the Transform node offers a powerful tool for managing JSON data within workflows.

Wait till Specifies that the workflow should wait until the specified time period is reached before proceeding. Wait Till has 2 additional Input fields, Before or After Base Date and the Base Date field. ​ Steps to Use Delay Node To incorporate a Delay node into a workflow, follow these steps: 1 Create Workflow Begin by navigating to the respective app and creating a new workflow. Add an event and publish the workflow to activate it. Learn more about Workflows here . 2 Add Delay Node Within the workflow, add a Delay node as per your requirement along with other nodes to define the workflow flow. 3 Configure Delay Action In the Delay node, select the action type as either Wait for or Wait till depending on the desired behavior. Specify the duration of the delay by entering the desired values for Days , Hours , Minutes , and Seconds . By default, the values will be set as 0 for all the input fields. Currently Cobalt supports only integral values for the Input fields in Delay Node. During workflow execution, the Delay node introduces a pause in execution for the specified time period before proceeding to the next action. If the rule condition is specified for the Delay node and it is met, then the workflow will execute as per the defined delay duration else the Delay node will be skipped.

When creating application integrations, accessing customer’s data is a required step. Using Cobalt’s auth flows this process becomes both quick and heavily customizable. ​ Pre-requisites Below are a few pre-requisites that you need to do before choosing an Auth Flow: 1. Create Linked Account In order to enable your customer to connect to third party app, you first need to create a Linked account for them using a unique identifier. Know more about Linked Accounts and how you can create one in the guide here . We recommend you create a linked account at the same time as your customer signs up within your app. 2. Generate Session Token Generate a Session Token for your Linked Account. The session token gets expired in 24 hours. Please make sure you generate a new token in every new session or within 24 hours. ​ Auth flow integration options Cobalt provides 3 different ways for Auth flow of integrations Hosted flow Redirects user to Cobalt Connect hosted on `https://connect.gocobalt.io`. Hosted flow is a no-code solution, so you don’t need to build your own UI to handle the integration authentication. It handles the following features: List all enabled applications Handle the Auth flow Manage integration configuration for your end user. Dynamic field mapping feature is currently not supported in the Hosted auth flow. To get started, follow the 2 steps: 1 Generate Hosted URL To use Hosted flow, you will need to first get the hosted URL. This can be achieved by making a POST request to the Create Hosted URL API. Check out the Cobalt’s API Reference for more details. 2 Redirect to Hosted portal The generated URL can be then used to redirect the user to the Hosted UI, or can be embedded within your UI. Your user can select the application they want to connect and perform authentication. You can modify the UI of Hosted Portal using the hosted_properties . Property Description color Modify the theme color of Cobalt connect name Display name of your end customer bgColor Background Colour of your end customer Embedded Flow Utilize the React SDK and embed it seamlessly within your React application. Cobalt Embedded flow is a frontend SDK that allows you to embed Cobalt auth flow into your React application. It’s a simple process involving steps like Generate Session Token > Install and Initialise Frontend SDK and Render the Component . Learn more about Cobalt’s React SDK and how to initialize it here . For example implementation, you can check out the App.js file in the example directory. Seamless Flow Utilize our REST APIs and NodeJs SDK methods to implement and customize the authentication experience. Cobalt provides APIs and SDK functions that allow your customers to connect your platform with the third party applications. The general steps to build your own flow are: Display a list of integrations for your users to select Retrieve a list of all integrations available to connect using the List Applications API or .getApplications() method and display them in your UI. With the above call you can get all the details related to an appliction for a user. We recommend using the assets provided by Cobalt as they meet the requirements of the supported integrations. For example QuickBooks Online require the specific use of QuickBooks branded buttons, including specific hover states. Install and Initialise SDK Install the Cobalt Frontend SDK for JavaScript that you want to use. You can install by either using npm package manager or directly in browser by using the script tag. <!-- use a specific version --> < script src = \" https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@cobaltio/cobalt-js@3.0.1 \" > </ script > <!-- use a version range instead of a specific version --> < script src = \" https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@cobaltio/cobalt-js@3 \" > </ script > < script src = \" https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@cobaltio/cobalt-js@3.0 \" > </ script > <!-- omit the version completely to use the latest one --> <!-- you should NOT use this in production --> < script src = \" https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@cobaltio/cobalt-js \" > </ script > Initialize the javascript SDK using the Session token. Learn more about Cobalt’s JS SDK and how to initialize it here . Manage Connections Cobalt provides the flexibility for you to manage your customers’ application connections. The .connect() method lets your customers to connect to an application platform, authorizing you to access the platform APIs and data on their behalf. cobalt . connect ( \"slack\" ) // opens a new tab for oauth apps cobalt . connect ( \"twilio\" , { number : < \"Registered number\" > , sid : \"ACCOUNT_SID\" , } ) // saves the auth data for key based apps The .disconnect() method similarly, lets the user to disconnect from the application platform, revoking the authorization and deleting any and all configurations of the Linked account saved for that particular application. cobalt . disconnect ( \"slack\" ) Allow users to configure the connection Once the user has successfully authenticated in their platform, he is redirected back to your app integration page. Use the .config() method to find an exisiting config or creating a new config for the linked account. cobalt . config ( { slug : \"slack\" , config_id : \"OPTIONAL_ID_FOR_THIS_CONFIG\" , labels : { } , // optional dynamic labels } ) Save/Update the configuration The .config() method provides you with all the published workflows and settings input for the user. The user can now enable the workflows, enter data for the settings and map fields. These updates to the config can be made using the .updateConfig() method. cobalt . updateConfig ( { slug : \"slack\" , config_id : \"OPTIONAL_ID_FOR_THIS_CONFIG\" , fields : { \"64da0b57c9ae95561bb0a24d\" : \"C044U7Q074J\" } , workflows : [ { id : \"64d1fac58716dc5065127ffe\" , enabled : true , fields : { \"64da0b57c9ae95561bb0a24f\" : \"C044U7Q074J\" } } ] } ) ​ Authorization journey Cobalt lets you take the authorization for customer’s data in 3 simple steps: Open the auth flow portal for the customer using any of the above mentioned integration options. Customer provides consent or API Credentials for the respective app. Customer configures the data required for the connection, such as selecting specific integration settings. And done!

This is particularly useful when there are parallel processes within a workflow that need to converge at a common point before proceeding with the subsequent actions. ​ Use Case for Merge Consider a scenario where two parallel processes need to run simultaneously, and once both processes are completed, a common action or set of actions should be executed. So rather than replicating the same flow for each branch, leading to increased complexity and a higher number of nodes, the Merge Node allows these branches to converge seamlessly. The Merge will not be successful if any of the nodes which are being merged through the Merge Node are failing. ​ Example Scenario Parallel Processing : You have three branches/nodes running different processes in parallel. Convergence : Once all three branches complete their respective tasks, they need to converge to perform a common action, such as creating a datastore or any other action. By using the Merge Node, you can bring both branches together, eliminating the need to duplicate the subsequent steps for each branch.

To setup the Authorization for the Custom App, navigate to Authorization in the App and choose the desired method. The methods of Authorization are: Key Based If the Custom App requires API Key based authentication, select Key Based . It requires users to set up an API for generating access tokens. Follow the steps below to setup your custom app: 1 Select Key Auth type Select either of Basic Auth , Bearer Token or API Key as the auth mechanism. 2 Configure User Input Fields Add the input fields that will be visible to your users asking for the required API credentials and click on Save . 3 Map Auth fields Once you have added the required user input fields, map those fields now to setup auth data. 4 Add Base URL Provide the Base URL of the API endpoints for the custom app and the key code for Invalid API Credentials. 5 Setup Identifier and Validation Optionally, you can also provide an endpoint which will be called to perform validation of the provided credentials. Its recommended to provide a GET API endpoint to perform validation, so as to avoid modifying any data using the credentials. Congratulations! You have successfully setup a Key based Custom Application in Cobalt. OAuth 2.0 If you want to provide OAuth 2.0 type authorization, select OAuth 2.0 in the methods. Follow the steps below to configure OAuth mechanism for your custom app: 1 Provide OAuth Credentials Add the Client ID , Client Secret and the Scopes of the developer OAuth 2.0 app that you have created. Ensure that you add the provided Callback URL in your developer OAuth 2.0 app. 2 Add Authorization and Token URL Add the Authorization and Token URL required for OAuth authentication in the provided fields, select Client Authentication type and Save . You can find both the URLs from the Authentication documentation of the custom app that you are setting up. 3 Setup Refresh Mechanism and API Base URL In the API Setup section, provide the Base URL for the APIs and appropriate code i.e. Expired Access Token Codes which is received on token expiry for the Refresh mechanism to work. 4 Setup Identifier and Validation Optionally, you can also provide an endpoint which will be called to perform validation of the provided credentials. Its recommended to provide a GET API endpoint to perform validation, so as to avoid modifying any data using the credentials. 5 Extract Access Token & Refresh Token In the Auth Tokens Data section, you will provide the mapping using which the tokens can be extracted once received on callback on successful authorization. Usually an object is received after authorization which will be saved as access_token_response on Cobalt’s end and you need to provide the key mapping of the required fields from the object. Congratulations! You have successfully setup a OAuth 2.0 Custom Application in Cobalt. No Auth Select this option if no authentication is required for accessing the custom app. ​ Custom Actions for App Custom Apps support the addition of Actions of APIs. ​ Create Custom Action Select Custom Actions , click on the New Action button and provide a Name and Description . Add any required or optional Fields for the API and add the API under API Call section. Provide the API by breaking it into 2 parts i.e. Base URL and the Endpoint. ​ Enable Pagination for Custom Action If the Action’s API supports pagination, then you can add it to the custom action.

You take inputs from your end customers to facilitate your desired orchestration. To do so, Cobalt supports various types of fields to define the settings. ​ Primitive field types Primitive field types are the basic input types defned by Cobalt. Text , Number , Select , Email & Date fields can be used by the users to take inputs with the respective types from the user. You can let you customers select from a list of options defined by you, using the Select field type. The end customer can select a value from your defined options, Which can then be used in a workflow orchestration. ​ Select field types There might arise conditions where you want your end customers to select from a list which is platform specific and cannot be configured using Primitive field types. For example, List of Stages or List of Tags . Such lists are platform specific and prone to changes. As a result hard coding the options using Primitive field types is not recommended. To cater to such issues, Cobalt provides Select Fields . To use Select fields, create a setting as any and select the type from the list of Select fields available. The users can then select from the options defined for the field which is fetched from the platform in real time. The below image shows the list of Pipedrive Select fields to choose from. ​ Map type Select fields Some of the select fields are of Map type. These fields are used to map a platform defined list of properties to the triggers payload properties being sent by you. For example, Custom Contact fields. You can define labels and ask the users to map the labels with the required custom properties defined in the platform. In the example, a map type field is being configured to map Department, and Shift to any Pipedrive property.

Navigation Developer Settings Events Documentation Implementation & Guides API Reference SDKs Resources Cobalt home page v2 Postman Get Your API Key Examples Developer Settings Overview Events API Proxy Platform Account Management Webhooks Tables by Cobalt Try API Developer Settings Events Events are the trigger entities that are used to define a start point of a workflow and can be triggered using the REST APIs or the Event URL assigned for the Organization. Think of these custom events as signals sent from your app using the Cobalt SDK or Event API to kick off different processes. Cobalt events are common models . This means once you set it up, one event can make several workflows get executed. This is handy when you want the same event to do similar things in different apps. For example, an event ‘User verified’ could set off one workflow in Salesforce and another in HubSpot, making it easy to achieve consistent integration across various platforms without needing extra technical work. Above image shows a user selecting from their default application events as a trigger for a Pipedrive workflow. ​ Creating an event An event model contains name of the event and the trigger payload. The trigger payload contains sample data schema that can be used as data variables and are used inside a workflow as placeholders while defining the workflow. The actual data passed while triggering the event takes place of those variables inside the workflows. To create an event, go to Settings > Developer > Events, Click on New Event and select a model. Change the name and update the sample payload as per your requirement and click Create event . It is expected that you pass on the data as the Sample Payload while you are triggering this event. This is because, the properties defined in the sample payload can be used as trigger variables inside a workflow. In the below example, we are using firstName defined inside the Contact event in an Activecampaign workflow. Now, when you actually trigger the event Contact , this workflow will get executed with name field consisting of the value sent by you as firstName while triggering the event. ​ Triggering an event. Cobalt events can be triggered using various methods. You can make use of the Event URL . Go to Settings > Developer > Events Copy the event URL. Then copy the event that you would like to trigger. See below for reference, Then you can just make the POST API call with linked_account_id and x-api-key in the headers curl --request POST \\ --url https://api.gocobalt.io/api/v1/webhook/64c357c739ec788238ab5f9b \\ --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \\ --header 'linked_account_id: <linked_account_id>' \\ --header 'x-api-key: <x-api-key>' \\ --data '{ \"event\": \"Add Contact\", \"payload\": { \"first_name\": \"Subrat\", \"last_name\": \"Dash\", \"email\": \"subrat.1108@gmail.com\", \"phone\": \"7624826260\", \"id\": \"\" } }' In the above cURL example, we have not mentioned the config_id in the headers. The config id essentially defines the default config with which the worflow shall be executed. If config_id is not mentioned, Cobalt considers the linked_account_id as the config_id by default. Event URL can be used as a quick resort to trigger an event. If you wish to have better control on triggering such as triggering the worflow executions for a specific application, instead of for all application workflows with which the event is associated, kindly refer the REST APIs support for events. To trigger an event from Cobalt platform so that you can simulate event execution, test workflows and validate the behavior of associated actions, you can use the Try API feature of Cobalt.

It allows you to: Execute multiple test cases for a workflow by modifying the input payload. Test and inspect the output values of each workflow node. Use the Run Node button at the bottom of each step to execute it for the authenticated Linked Account. ​ Pre-requisites for Workflow Testing Before testing a workflow, ensure the following steps are completed: Configure a Linked Account Click the Configuration button in the workflow editor and select a Linked Account under Prerequisites for the workflow. If the Linked Account is not authenticated with the integration or if its authentication has expired, a warning will appear. Click the Authorize Application button to reauthenticate or establish a connection with the integration. Once authentication is complete, a Connected status will be displayed. Click Next to proceed. Provide a Sample Payload Enter a payload with data to be used during workflow testing. A sample payload will automatically load based on the event trigger defined in the workflow. Modify the sample payload if necessary to suit your testing requirements. After completing these steps, click the Save Configuration button. Your workflow is now ready for testing. ​ Steps to test Cobalt provides options for testing both ndividual nodes or the entire workflow. ​ Testing Node 1 Select Node Click on the node you want to test. 2 Run Node At the bottom of the editor, click the Run Node button. Testing for Group Node and Pagination is currently not supported. 3 Check Input and Output Expand the testing modal by clicking the ^ button at the bottom and view the input and output details of the test run under the Node tab. Once the node executes successfully, a checkmark appears on the node, indicating it has been tested. ​ Testing Entire Workflow Open the testing modal present at the bottom and switch from the Node tab to the Workflow tab. Click on Run Workflow button to perform a test execution and a Test Run log is generated with output of each node. Since testing for Group nodes is not supported currently, you might not receive the logs of the group node. ​ Workflow Templating In Cobalt workflows, you can use dynamic variables generated through Run Node test execution to seamlessly access data from previous nodes. This method allows you to incorporate tested node response data into subsequent nodes. To learn more about how to do Templating in Cobalt, refer to the docs here . Simply go to input field where you want to use variable within a node, select Nodes tab from the Insert Variable modal, choose the node whose response you want to access and select the field from that node response. In this example, we used the id received in the response when project was created and it’s visible as 4.id in the field which is of the format <node_number>.<response_field> . This streamlined approach of Workflow Testing ensures that your workflows perform as expected before deploying them in production.

Cobalt connect lets your users connect their integration accounts. It stores the credentials securely and lets you make authorized API calls on your users’ behalf (linked account in Cobalt). ​ Enable & Configure Apps To enable the apps that you want to use in Cobalt, go to the Apps page in the Cobalt dashboard. You will see a list of the available apps. Choose one or more apps to enable. The apps that you enable will become available to your users in the Connect flow. Key-based apps do not require any additional configuration. OAuth apps by default use Cobalt credentials. This makes it easy to get started and connect integrations right away. However, once you’re ready to ship your integrations with Cobalt, you should use your own OAuth app credentials (client ID and client secret). This will make sure that users see your brand instead of Cobalt when they connect integrations. You can find the App Setup instructions for some of the popular integrations that we support here . ​ Building Custom UI If you want to build a custom UI for your integrations, you can do so by using the Cobalt APIs or the Cobalt Connect SDK available in JavaScript and React. Cobalt API for UI If you want to create your own frontend for the integration and want to fetch information about the various integrations that will be available to the end-users, you can do so by using the List Applications API . Request : This API will list all the apps that were enabled above. Make a GET request to the /application endpoint with the linked_account_id of the user. cURL curl -- request GET \\ -- url https : / / api . gocobalt . io / api / v2 / public / application \\ -- header 'linked_account_id: <linked_account_id>' \\ -- header 'x-api-key: <api-key>' Handle Response : The /application endpoint will respond with an array containing the List of Applications that were enabled for the end-user.

Trigger determines when the workflow will run and how data is passed into the workflow. Triggers are setup in the Start Node of workflow. Following are the available workflow trigger types. ​ App Events App Events are custom events that are sent from your application via the Cobalt SDK or API to trigger Workflows. In general, App Events are useful for triggering workflows that map data from your application to your users’ apps. For example, you might send a Contact Created App Event from your application to trigger a Workflow that creates a matching contact in your users’ Salesforce CRM. An App Event can be used to trigger multiple workflows. This is useful in cases where you may want the same event to trigger similar workflows across different integrations. Learn more about Events in our guide here . ​ Default App Triggers Default App triggers can be used to run workflows based on events in your users’ apps in real-time. This is achieved through the app’s webhooks and are available as Triggers in the integration. For example, you might want to trigger a workflow whenever new contacts are created in your users’ Salesforce account, to sync contacts to your application in real-time. Then this can be done by using the Contact Created trigger. ​ Schedule The Scheduler trigger is used for workflows that should run automatically at a scheduled time or interval. Minutes (e.g. every 30 minutes) Hourly (e.g. every hour at 15 minutes past the hour) Daily (e.g. every 2 days at 9:00 am) The minimum time that can be set in scheduler should be greater than 5 minutes. Once deployed, the workflow will run automatically at the designated time for all users who have activated the workflow. ​ Workflow API The Workflow API in Cobalt allows users to execute workflows programmatically instead of relying on event-based triggers. This API-based execution provides flexibility in triggering workflows directly through an API call. Know more about Workflow API here .

This section of Cobalt’s platform is dedicated to setup the default application settings which would be useful in other Cobalt’s core functionalities, such as triggering an event, or calling a custom action. You can easily create common Events to trigger workflows or define a custom Action api setup to fire when required. ​ Setting up default authentication If your API are API key based, you can easily set the API keys for each linked account while creating them. Everytime the associated action is fired, the credentials will be set in the headers by default. Use this API reference for a detailed understanding. However if your api authentication is a bit more complex, such as getting a token using other credentials and using it for the authorization, Cobalt grants this provision as well. To do so first save the required data specific to the auth mechanism as UDF parameters, for example: Base URL , Region , API Key , API Secret etc; ​ Authentication Here, you can configure the API call to be made to fetch an access token each time before an action defined by you is to be executed. The below example describes setting up an api call using the base_url , access_key and secret as linked account variables. These values needs to be first set as UDF parameters while the linked account is being created. Check out this API reference for details. Here, the user is making a POST request to its server path /auth with api-key api-secret & Content-Type as header parameters. We expect as token object in return. ​ Injection details we get the token response from the above API call in the following way: { \"id\" : \"cfa64467-87be-4ef6-9cac-78477d77457c\" , \"token\" : \"<access token generated using credentials>\" , \"label\" : \"Access Token\" } Upon receiving the token object in response, we need to define where to set it while making an API call to the server. This can be achieved in this section. In the below example we are setting the token as a header parameter for any forthcoming API calls to the server via the default application’s actions.

Navigation UDF Parameter Documentation Implementation & Guides API Reference SDKs Resources Cobalt home page v2 Postman Get Your API Key Examples Developer Settings Overview Events API Proxy Platform Account Management Webhooks Tables by Cobalt Try API UDF Parameter UDF (User Defined Field) parameters in Cobalt offer a flexible mechanism for users to assign custom key-value pairs to Linked Accounts, allowing for enhanced control and customization within workflows. These parameters enable users to tailor workflows and configurations based on specific criteria defined by the UDF values. With the ability to create multiple UDF parameters for a single Linked Account, users gain granular control over workflow access and customization. ​ Creating UDF Parameters To create a UDF parameter for a Linked Account, follow these steps: Navigate to Linked Accounts in Cobalt and choose the Linked Account for which UDF needs to be added. Click on the Update UDF button in the right side. Specify the name of the UDF parameter and its corresponding value, click on + and click on the Save button. The UDF Parameter is added to the Linked account. This intuitive process allows users to define custom attributes for Linked Accounts. ​ Workflow Access Control UDF parameters play a crucial role in workflow access control within the Cobalt platform. Users can leverage UDF parameters to filter configurations for Linked Accounts, thereby controlling access to specific workflows based on predefined criteria. In the Config Portal of a Workflow, users have the option to define Access conditions, such as Match all conditions or Match any condition . Users can then specify the name of the UDF parameter and its corresponding value that should be allowed to access the Workflow. ​ Example Use Case Let’s consider a scenario where the user requires that only few users with the Admin rights can Reply in a Thread in Slack. To manage access to this workflow within Cobalt , the company can utilize UDF parameters. By assigning a UDF parameter named Role with values such as Administrator , Member and Guest to Linked Accounts, the company can filter configurations in workflows based on the role of each Linked Account. To use the UDF parameter in the workflow, the user will follow these steps: User will create UDF parameter named Role in the Linked accounts and assign them values. Navigate to Apps > Search for Slack > Workflows > Create a new workflow or Choose an existing one > Click on Config Portal in the top right corner. Learn how to create a workflow here . Go to Access > Select Match All Conditions > Enter Name as Role and Value as Administrator > Click on + > Click on Save . This workflow will now not be visible to the Linked Accounts who do not have the Role as Administrator. UDF parameters in Cobalt empower users to customize workflows, control access, and tailor configurations based on specific criteria defined by custom key-value pairs. By leveraging UDF parameters effectively, users can optimize workflow management and ensure efficient integration with their business processes. linkedin twitter Powered by Mintlify On this page Creating UDF Parameters Workflow Access Control Example Use Case"

A webhook is a method to provide external applications with real-time information about data changes in a platform. A webhook delivers data to the application at the moment that there is a change, resulting in data being pushed. Unlike REST APIs where the application polls the API at regular intervals in order to get the changed data. This makes webhooks much more efficient and friendly. ​ Event Types Currently Cobalt 5 webhook event types: Connection Created A connection is created { \"linked_account_id\" : \"12345\" , \"org_id\" : \"645270e37917442c4307297a\" , \"environment\" : \"test\" , \"type\" : \"General\" , \"event\" : \"Connection Created\" , \"slug\" : \"hubspot\" , \"createdAt\" : \"Tue, 07 Nov 2023 08:03:27 GMT\" } Connection Deleted A connection is deleted { \"linked_account_id\" : \"12345\" , \"org_id\" : \"645270e37917442c4307297a\" , \"environment\" : \"test\" , \"type\" : \"General\" , \"event\" : \"Connection Deleted\" , \"slug\" : \"hubspot\" , \"createdAt\" : \"Tue, 07 Nov 2023 08:04:27 GMT\" } Connection Expired A connection is removed or does not exist { \"linked_account_id\" : \"12345\" , \"org_id\" : \"645270e37917442c4307297a\" , \"environment\" : \"test\" , \"type\" : \"General\" , \"event\" : \"Connection Expired\" , \"slug\" : \"pipedrive\" , \"createdAt\" : \"Tue, 07 Nov 2023 08:38:33 GMT\" } Workflow Completed Workflow has been successfully executed { \"linked_account_id\" : \"12345\" , \"instance_id\" : \"656f30f69144bb8f183c0118\" , \"workflow_id\" : \"6495792b9b6ca6d77a17e513\" , \"config_id\" : \"12345\" , \"event\" : \"Workflow Completed\" , \"workflow_name\" : \"Export contact to Hubspot\" , \"status\" : \"COMPLETED\" } Workflow Errored Workflow execution stopped because of an error { \"linked_account_id\" : \"12345\" , \"instance_id\" : \"656f308b9144bb8f183bfc7b\" , \"workflow_id\" : \"6495792b9b6ca6d77a17e513\" , \"config_id\" : \"12345\" , \"event\" : \"Workflow Errored\" , \"workflow_name\" : \"Export contact to Hubspot\" , \"status\" : \"ERRORED\" } ​ How to subscribe to webhook events?

Think of these custom events as signals sent from your app using the Cobalt SDK or Event API to kick off different processes. Cobalt events are common models . This means once you set it up, one event can make several workflows get executed. This is handy when you want the same event to do similar things in different apps. ​ Creating an event An event model contains name of the event and the trigger payload. The trigger payload contains sample data schema that can be used as data variables and are used inside a workflow as placeholders while defining the workflow. The actual data passed while triggering the event takes place of those variables inside the workflows. To create an event, go to Settings > Developer > Events, Click on New Event and select a model. Change the name and update the sample payload as per your requirement and click Create event . It is expected that you pass on the data as the Sample Payload while you are triggering this event. This is because, the properties defined in the sample payload can be used as trigger variables inside a workflow. In the below example, we are using firstName defined inside the Contact event in a HubSpot workflow. Now, when you actually trigger the event Contact , this workflow will get executed with name field consisting of the value sent by you as firstName while triggering the event. ​ Triggering an event. Cobalt events can be triggered using various methods. You can make use of the Event URL . Go to Settings > Developer > Events Copy the event URL. Then click on the event that you would like to trigger to get its cURL. See below for reference Then you can just make the POST API call with linked_account_id and x-api-key in the headers curl --request POST \\ --url https://api.gocobalt.io/api/v1/webhook/64c357c739ec788238ab5f9b \\ --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \\ --header 'linked_account_id: <linked_account_id>' \\ --header 'x-api-key: <x-api-key>' \\ --data '{ \"event\": \"Add Contact\", \"payload\": { \"first_name\": \"Subrat\", \"last_name\": \"Dash\", \"email\": \"subrat.1108@gmail.com\", \"phone\": \"7624826260\", \"id\": \"\" } }' In the above cURL example, we have not mentioned the config_id in the headers. The config id essentially defines the default config with which the worflow shall be executed. If config_id is not mentioned, Cobalt considers the linked_account_id as the config_id by default. Event URL can be used as a quick resort to trigger an event. If you wish to have better control on triggering such as triggering the worflow executions for a specific application, instead of for all application workflows with which the event is associated, kindly refer the REST APIs support for events. To trigger an event from Cobalt platform so that you can simulate event execution, test workflows and validate the behavior of associated actions, you can use the Try API feature of Cobalt.

Navigation Examples Build Salesforce Integration Documentation Implementation & Guides API Reference SDKs Resources Cobalt home page v2 Postman Get Your API Key Examples Implementation Guide Get Started Integrate Communicate Test Integration Additional Deploy Examples Build Salesforce Integration Build NetSuite Integration Build Workday Integration Solutions 2 Way Data Sync Data Import Push Data to External Connector Examples Build Salesforce Integration In this guide, we will walk through the essential steps required to build a Salesforce integration using the Cobalt platform. This process involves three major steps i.e. User Authentication with Salesforce, Creating Workflows and Using workflows for users. ​ Authenticating with Salesforce integration To get started, first you need to enable the Salesforce integration in your account and also setup some basic processes. 1 Enable the Salesforce App Step 1: Enable the Salesforce App After setting up your account, the next step is to enable the Salesforce app in your Cobalt account. Apps cannot be enabled using the API. You will need to enable the app through the UI. To enable the Salesforce app: Navigate to Apps in Cobalt and search for Salesforce and enable the app by clicking on the Go Live button in the top right corner. Now, go to Settings and provide the Client ID and Client Secret of your Salesforce OAuth app and click on Save . Follow the steps given here to get your credentials. Once the app is enabled, you can proceed to create and manage workflows and linked accounts associated with Salesforce. 2 Create a Linked Account Step 2: Create a Linked Account A Linked Account in Cobalt represents the end-users or customers who will use the integration through the platform. Each Linked Account requires a unique linked_account_id, which typically corresponds to an ID from your internal data model (e.g., a user or account ID). Learn more about Linked Accounts here . To upsert (create or update) a Linked Account, use the following API call: Param Required Type Description linked_account_id Mandatory String Unique customer identifier name Optional String Name of the customer You can check the Linked Accounts in your Cobalt account by navigating to the Linked Accounts section in the side menu. Once the Linked Account is successfully created or updated, it will be ready for authentication in the next step. 3 Generate Session Token for your Linked Account Step 3: Generate Token After creating a Linked Account, the next step is to generate a session token. Session tokens help protect your Cobalt API key and manage end-customer tokens more securely. To create a session token, use the following API call: This session token will be included in subsequent requests to Cobalt APIs to authenticate and authorize the actions. 4 Open Hosted Portal Auth Flow Step 4: Open Hosted Portal Auth Flow Next, you will need to generate a Hosted URL that your users will use to authenticate with Salesforce. Cobalt securely stores the credentials and handles API calls on behalf of your users. Use the following API call to generate the Hosted URL: The response will return a Hosted URL that your users can visit to authenticate and connect their Salesforce accounts. Hosted Portal is a no-code solution provided by Cobalt that removes the need to build your own UI for handling integration authentication and configuration. 5 Authenticate Using Hosted Portal Step 5: Perform OAuth Authentication Visit the Hosted URL provided in the API response. The Hosted Portal will display all the integrations you have enabled, including Salesforce. To authenticate: Navigate to the Salesforce integration in the portal. Click Connect to begin the authentication process and allow consent to permissions requested. After completing the flow, you will be redirected back to the Hosted Portal with a confirmation that the account is successfully connected. You have successfully authenticated with Salesforce integration. The next step is to create workflows for your use-case. ​ Creating Workflows in Salesforce There are 3 major categories of workflows that you can create in any integration. Data Import from Salesforce Sync data from Salesforce to your system. Push Data to Salesforce Create data on Salesforce from your system. 2-way sync between Salesforce and you Keep the data between Salesforce and your system in sync. Let’s look at a sample workflow for each case. ​ Data Import from Salesforce Consider a use-case where you want to sync all the opportunities present in Salesforce to your system. In the Salesforce integration, go to Workflows and create a new workflow by clicking on +Add Workflow button and name it as Sync Opportunities . Data Import from Salesforce Follow the steps given to build the workflow: 1 Add Trigger in Start Node All workflows start with a trigger, which determines when the workflow will run and how data is passed into the workflow. For this workflow we will use the Event Based trigger. Learn more about the triggers and its types here . Click on the Start Node , select your native app option and click on + Create New Event . Give a name to your event and keep the payload as an empty object. 2 Add Salesforce Node Now to fetch all the opportunities present in your user’s account, we need to call Salesforce API. Click on Nodes option in the top right and drag the Salesforce Node from Native Apps section to the workflow builder. Connect this node with Start Node. 3 Fetch Opportunities from Salesforce using Action Click on the Salesforce Node and select Get Entity with SOQL action. Add the following under SOQL query field and click on Save . SELECT Id,Amount,AccountId, CloseDate,ContactId,Description,ExpectedRevenue,LeadSource, Name, OwnerId, Probability,StageName,Type FROM Opportunity You can provide any additonal fields that you want to fetch about opportunities from Salesforce by adding it to this query. 4 Add Custom Code node We have fetched all the opportunities, but you might require to structure it as a payload which your platform can receive. Let’s do this using Custom Code node. Drag the Custom Code from the Utility Nodes section onto the workflow builder and connect it with Salesforce node. 5 Mapping Opportunity fields Click on + Map Fields under Input Parameters, add key name as deals and in value we will provide the response received through Salesforce node which will be restructured. In Value , select Nodes tab under Insert Variable and click on + of the Salesforce Node. You can now do mapping using JavaScript code. Try the sample code provided below: function yourFunction(params) { const res = params.deals.map(ele=>{ const output = { id: ele.Id, title: ele.Name, description: ele.Description || 'Description not available', close_date: ele.CloseDate, amount: ele.Amount, expected_revenue: ele.ExpectedRevenue, status: ele.StageName } return output }) return {\"result\": res || [] } } 6 API Proxy in Workflow You have successfully fetched all opportunities and structured the payload. Now to receive it in your server, you need to configure an API Proxy. In Cobalt Dashboard, navigate to Developer > API Proxies and click on New Action . Configure an API endpoint, where you want to receive the response. If you want to test, go to webhook.site and copy Your unique URL and configure this as a POST Request and Save . Learn more about API Proxies here . 7 Use API Proxy in Workflow From Native Apps nodes, add your org’s Node and connect it with Custom Code. Click on the node and select the API Proxy that you created from the Actions. Add the response from Custom Code node in data field and click on Save . Ensure that you add a field in the API Proxy where you can pass the JSON data and then added it to the API Call body as well in the POST request. Hurray!! You have successfully created a Salesforce workflow to sync all the opportunities to your system. ​ Push Data to Salesforce Consider a use-case where you want to create a contact present in your system to Salesforce. This workflow will be fired when you send an Event with the payload of the contact to be added. In the Salesforce integration, go to Workflows and create a new workflow by clicking on +Add Workflow button and name it as Create New Contact . Push Data to Salesforce Follow the steps given to build the workflow: 1 Add Trigger in Start Node All workflows start with a trigger, which determines when the workflow will run and how data is passed into the workflow. For this workflow we will use the Event Based trigger. Learn more about the triggers and its types here . Click on the Start Node , select your native app option and click on + Create New Event . Give a name to your event and provide all the data related to the contact in the payload. 2 Add Salesforce Node Now to create a new contact in Salesforce, we need to call Salesforce API. Click on Nodes option in the top right and drag the Salesforce Node from Native Apps section to the workflow builder. Connect this node with Start Node. 3 Add Action in node Click on Salesforce Node and add the Create Contact action. To provide the data in all the fields from your Event payload, just click on a field and from the Event tab under Insert Variable, select the fields from the body that you sent as payload. Ensure that all the mandatory fields in the action are filled, else the Salesforce API will give error. Hurray!! You have successfully created a Salesforce workflow to create a new contact. ​ 2-way sync between Salesforce and you (Webhooks) For bi-directional sync, usually three workflows are required: Workflow for Initial sync where all the records are fetched from Salesforce. This is the same workflow as Data Import workflow that we created here . Workflow to push record in Salesforce when a new record is created on your platform. We created this workflow of Push Data here . Workflow to update records in your system whenever a contact gets created or updated in Salesforce. Update records workflow To perform a real time update whenever a change happens in Salesforce, we will use Salesforce Webhook as a trigger for our workflow. Follow the steps given below to setup your workflow: 1 Add Salesforce Webhook as trigger In the Start Node, select Salesforce as the trigger and select Contact Created event. Similarly, you can use the Contact Updated event to get notified whenever a contact is updated in Salesforce. By using the Contact Created trigger, you will receive data as an event payload about any new contact created in Salesforce in real time. 2 Send New Contact data to your system Send the data that we received about the new contact to your system to perform real time sync. From Native Apps nodes, add your org’s Node and connect it with Start Node. Click on the node and select the API Proxy that you created from the Actions to receive new contact info. Add the response from Event using Insert Variables and click on Save . Ensure that you add a field in the API Proxy where you can pass the data and then added it to the API Call body as well in the POST request. Hurray! You have successfully created a workflow which will inform you whenever a new contact is created in Salesforce. You have successfully created the workflows for your use case. Next step is to enable and execute those workflows for your Linked Accounts. ​ Executing the Workflows To run these workflows for your users or Linked Accounts, you need to do the following steps: 1 Create Config for Linked Account Config is a customization that you store for each integration of your end-customers. Create Config You can create config for the Linked Account through the Cobalt Connect SDKs or using the APIs. You can use the .config() method or the Create Config API which returns the specified config or creates one if it doesn’t exist for the Linked Account. Make a request with the Application Slug and linked_account_id as mandatory fields for it. You can request in the following way: It will return information about config of the application for the Linked Account and provides you with all the published workflows and settings input for the user required to execute the workflow. Response { \"slug\" : \"salesforce\" , \"config_id\" : \"OPTIONAL_ID_FOR_THIS_CONFIG\" , \"fields\" : [ ] , \"workflows\" : [ { \"id\" : \"64d1fac58716dc5065127ffe\" , \"name\" : \"Sync Opportunities\" , \"description\" : \"\" , \"enabled\" : false , \"fields\" : [ ] } ] , \"field_errors\" : [ ] } 2 Enable Workflow Now you need to enable the workflow for your Linked account. You can either ask the user to enable them or you can do so for them by using the Update Config API or .updateconfig() method. Make the following request: In response, you get the updated config information for the application. 3 Third Step Once the required workflows are enabled, you need to fire event to start execution. You can use the Trigger Event for app API with the following request: cURL curl -- request POST \\ -- url https : / / api . gocobalt . io / api / v2 / public / event / : slug \\ -- header 'Content-Type: application/json' \\ -- header 'linked_account_id: <linked_account_id>' \\ -- header 'x-api-key: <api-key>' \\ -- data ' { \"event\" : \"<string>\" , \"payload\" : { } } ' 4 Check Execution Logs Once the workflow execution has been fired, you can check the Logs of the workflow here . Learn more about logs and observability here . Congratulations!! You have successfully created a Salesforce integration and executed it for your users.

Navigation Examples Build Salesforce Integration Documentation Implementation & Guides API Reference SDKs Resources Cobalt home page v2 Postman Get Your API Key Examples Implementation Guide Get Started Integrate Communicate Test Integration Additional Deploy Examples Build Salesforce Integration Build NetSuite Integration Build Workday Integration Solutions 2 Way Data Sync Data Import Push Data to External Connector Examples Build Salesforce Integration In this guide, we will walk through the essential steps required to build a Salesforce integration using the Cobalt platform. This process involves three major steps i.e. User Authentication with Salesforce, Creating Workflows and Using workflows for users. ​ Authenticating with Salesforce integration To get started, first you need to enable the Salesforce integration in your account and also setup some basic processes. 1 Enable the Salesforce App Step 1: Enable the Salesforce App After setting up your account, the next step is to enable the Salesforce app in your Cobalt account. Apps cannot be enabled using the API. You will need to enable the app through the UI. To enable the Salesforce app: Navigate to Apps in Cobalt and search for Salesforce and enable the app by clicking on the Go Live button in the top right corner. Now, go to Settings and provide the Client ID and Client Secret of your Salesforce OAuth app and click on Save . Follow the steps given here to get your credentials. Once the app is enabled, you can proceed to create and manage workflows and linked accounts associated with Salesforce. 2 Create a Linked Account Step 2: Create a Linked Account A Linked Account in Cobalt represents the end-users or customers who will use the integration through the platform. Each Linked Account requires a unique linked_account_id, which typically corresponds to an ID from your internal data model (e.g., a user or account ID). Learn more about Linked Accounts here . To upsert (create or update) a Linked Account, use the following API call: Param Required Type Description linked_account_id Mandatory String Unique customer identifier name Optional String Name of the customer You can check the Linked Accounts in your Cobalt account by navigating to the Linked Accounts section in the side menu. Once the Linked Account is successfully created or updated, it will be ready for authentication in the next step. 3 Generate Session Token for your Linked Account Step 3: Generate Token After creating a Linked Account, the next step is to generate a session token. Session tokens help protect your Cobalt API key and manage end-customer tokens more securely. To create a session token, use the following API call: This session token will be included in subsequent requests to Cobalt APIs to authenticate and authorize the actions. 4 Open Hosted Portal Auth Flow Step 4: Open Hosted Portal Auth Flow Next, you will need to generate a Hosted URL that your users will use to authenticate with Salesforce. Cobalt securely stores the credentials and handles API calls on behalf of your users. Use the following API call to generate the Hosted URL: The response will return a Hosted URL that your users can visit to authenticate and connect their Salesforce accounts. Hosted Portal is a no-code solution provided by Cobalt that removes the need to build your own UI for handling integration authentication and configuration. 5 Authenticate Using Hosted Portal Step 5: Perform OAuth Authentication Visit the Hosted URL provided in the API response. The Hosted Portal will display all the integrations you have enabled, including Salesforce. To authenticate: Navigate to the Salesforce integration in the portal. Click Connect to begin the authentication process and allow consent to permissions requested. After completing the flow, you will be redirected back to the Hosted Portal with a confirmation that the account is successfully connected. You have successfully authenticated with Salesforce integration. The next step is to create workflows for your use-case. ​ Creating Workflows in Salesforce There are 3 major categories of workflows that you can create in any integration. Data Import from Salesforce Sync data from Salesforce to your system. Push Data to Salesforce Create data on Salesforce from your system. 2-way sync between Salesforce and you Keep the data between Salesforce and your system in sync. Let’s look at a sample workflow for each case. ​ Data Import from Salesforce Consider a use-case where you want to sync all the opportunities present in Salesforce to your system. In the Salesforce integration, go to Workflows and create a new workflow by clicking on +Add Workflow button and name it as Sync Opportunities . Data Import from Salesforce Follow the steps given to build the workflow: 1 Add Trigger in Start Node All workflows start with a trigger, which determines when the workflow will run and how data is passed into the workflow. For this workflow we will use the Event Based trigger. Learn more about the triggers and its types here . Click on the Start Node , select your native app option and click on + Create New Event . Give a name to your event and keep the payload as an empty object. 2 Add Salesforce Node Now to fetch all the opportunities present in your user’s account, we need to call Salesforce API. Click on Nodes option in the top right and drag the Salesforce Node from Native Apps section to the workflow builder. Connect this node with Start Node. 3 Fetch Opportunities from Salesforce using Action Click on the Salesforce Node and select Get Entity with SOQL action. Add the following under SOQL query field and click on Save . SELECT Id,Amount,AccountId, CloseDate,ContactId,Description,ExpectedRevenue,LeadSource, Name, OwnerId, Probability,StageName,Type FROM Opportunity You can provide any additonal fields that you want to fetch about opportunities from Salesforce by adding it to this query. 4 Add Custom Code node We have fetched all the opportunities, but you might require to structure it as a payload which your platform can receive. Let’s do this using Custom Code node. Drag the Custom Code from the Utility Nodes section onto the workflow builder and connect it with Salesforce node. 5 Mapping Opportunity fields Click on + Map Fields under Input Parameters, add key name as deals and in value we will provide the response received through Salesforce node which will be restructured. In Value , select Nodes tab under Insert Variable and click on + of the Salesforce Node. You can now do mapping using JavaScript code. Try the sample code provided below: function yourFunction(params) { const res = params.deals.map(ele=>{ const output = { id: ele.Id, title: ele.Name, description: ele.Description || 'Description not available', close_date: ele.CloseDate, amount: ele.Amount, expected_revenue: ele.ExpectedRevenue, status: ele.StageName } return output }) return {\"result\": res || [] } } 6 API Proxy in Workflow You have successfully fetched all opportunities and structured the payload. Now to receive it in your server, you need to configure an API Proxy. In Cobalt Dashboard, navigate to Developer > API Proxies and click on New Action . Configure an API endpoint, where you want to receive the response. If you want to test, go to webhook.site and copy Your unique URL and configure this as a POST Request and Save . Learn more about API Proxies here . 7 Use API Proxy in Workflow From Native Apps nodes, add your org’s Node and connect it with Custom Code. Click on the node and select the API Proxy that you created from the Actions. Add the response from Custom Code node in data field and click on Save . Ensure that you add a field in the API Proxy where you can pass the JSON data and then added it to the API Call body as well in the POST request. Hurray!! You have successfully created a Salesforce workflow to sync all the opportunities to your system. ​ Push Data to Salesforce Consider a use-case where you want to create a contact present in your system to Salesforce. This workflow will be fired when you send an Event with the payload of the contact to be added. In the Salesforce integration, go to Workflows and create a new workflow by clicking on +Add Workflow button and name it as Create New Contact . Push Data to Salesforce Follow the steps given to build the workflow: 1 Add Trigger in Start Node All workflows start with a trigger, which determines when the workflow will run and how data is passed into the workflow. For this workflow we will use the Event Based trigger. Learn more about the triggers and its types here . Click on the Start Node , select your native app option and click on + Create New Event . Give a name to your event and provide all the data related to the contact in the payload. 2 Add Salesforce Node Now to create a new contact in Salesforce, we need to call Salesforce API. Click on Nodes option in the top right and drag the Salesforce Node from Native Apps section to the workflow builder. Connect this node with Start Node. 3 Add Action in node Click on Salesforce Node and add the Create Contact action. To provide the data in all the fields from your Event payload, just click on a field and from the Event tab under Insert Variable, select the fields from the body that you sent as payload. Ensure that all the mandatory fields in the action are filled, else the Salesforce API will give error. Hurray!! You have successfully created a Salesforce workflow to create a new contact. ​ 2-way sync between Salesforce and you (Webhooks) For bi-directional sync, usually three workflows are required: Workflow for Initial sync where all the records are fetched from Salesforce. This is the same workflow as Data Import workflow that we created here . Workflow to push record in Salesforce when a new record is created on your platform. We created this workflow of Push Data here . Workflow to update records in your system whenever a contact gets created or updated in Salesforce. Update records workflow To perform a real time update whenever a change happens in Salesforce, we will use Salesforce Webhook as a trigger for our workflow. Follow the steps given below to setup your workflow: 1 Add Salesforce Webhook as trigger In the Start Node, select Salesforce as the trigger and select Contact Created event. Similarly, you can use the Contact Updated event to get notified whenever a contact is updated in Salesforce. By using the Contact Created trigger, you will receive data as an event payload about any new contact created in Salesforce in real time. 2 Send New Contact data to your system Send the data that we received about the new contact to your system to perform real time sync. From Native Apps nodes, add your org’s Node and connect it with Start Node. Click on the node and select the API Proxy that you created from the Actions to receive new contact info. Add the response from Event using Insert Variables and click on Save . Ensure that you add a field in the API Proxy where you can pass the data and then added it to the API Call body as well in the POST request. Hurray! You have successfully created a workflow which will inform you whenever a new contact is created in Salesforce. You have successfully created the workflows for your use case. Next step is to enable and execute those workflows for your Linked Accounts. ​ Executing the Workflows To run these workflows for your users or Linked Accounts, you need to do the following steps: 1 Create Config for Linked Account Config is a customization that you store for each integration of your end-customers. Create Config You can create config for the Linked Account through the Cobalt Connect SDKs or using the APIs. You can use the .config() method or the Create Config API which returns the specified config or creates one if it doesn’t exist for the Linked Account. Make a request with the Application Slug and linked_account_id as mandatory fields for it. You can request in the following way: It will return information about config of the application for the Linked Account and provides you with all the published workflows and settings input for the user required to execute the workflow. Response { \"slug\" : \"salesforce\" , \"config_id\" : \"OPTIONAL_ID_FOR_THIS_CONFIG\" , \"fields\" : [ ] , \"workflows\" : [ { \"id\" : \"64d1fac58716dc5065127ffe\" , \"name\" : \"Sync Opportunities\" , \"description\" : \"\" , \"enabled\" : false , \"fields\" : [ ] } ] , \"field_errors\" : [ ] } 2 Enable Workflow Now you need to enable the workflow for your Linked account. You can either ask the user to enable them or you can do so for them by using the Update Config API or .updateconfig() method. Make the following request: In response, you get the updated config information for the application. 3 Third Step Once the required workflows are enabled, you need to fire event to start execution. You can use the Trigger Event for app API with the following request: cURL curl -- request POST \\ -- url https : / / api . gocobalt . io / api / v2 / public / event / : slug \\ -- header 'Content-Type: application/json' \\ -- header 'linked_account_id: <linked_account_id>' \\ -- header 'x-api-key: <api-key>' \\ -- data ' { \"event\" : \"<string>\" , \"payload\" : { } } ' 4 Check Execution Logs Once the workflow execution has been fired, you can check the Logs of the workflow here . Learn more about logs and observability here . Congratulations!! You have successfully created a Salesforce integration and executed it for your users.

To setup the Authorization for the Custom App, navigate to Authorization in the App and choose the desired method. The methods of Authorization are: Key Based If the Custom App requires API Key based authentication, select Key Based . It requires users to set up an API for generating access tokens. Follow the steps below to setup your custom app: 1 Select Key Auth type Select either of Basic Auth , Bearer Token or API Key as the auth mechanism. 2 Configure User Input Fields Add the input fields that will be visible to your users asking for the required API credentials and click on Save . 3 Map Auth fields Once you have added the required user input fields, map those fields now to setup auth data. 4 Add Base URL Provide the Base URL of the API endpoints for the custom app and the key code for Invalid API Credentials. 5 Setup Identifier and Validation Optionally, you can also provide an endpoint which will be called to perform validation of the provided credentials. Its recommended to provide a GET API endpoint to perform validation, so as to avoid modifying any data using the credentials. Congratulations! You have successfully setup a Key based Custom Application in Cobalt. OAuth 2.0 If you want to provide OAuth 2.0 type authorization, select OAuth 2.0 in the methods. Follow the steps below to configure OAuth mechanism for your custom app: 1 Provide OAuth Credentials Add the Client ID , Client Secret and the Scopes of the developer OAuth 2.0 app that you have created. Ensure that you add the provided Callback URL in your developer OAuth 2.0 app. 2 Add Authorization and Token URL Add the Authorization and Token URL required for OAuth authentication in the provided fields, select Client Authentication type and Save . You can find both the URLs from the Authentication documentation of the custom app that you are setting up. 3 Setup Refresh Mechanism and API Base URL In the API Setup section, provide the Base URL for the APIs and appropriate code i.e. Expired Access Token Codes which is received on token expiry for the Refresh mechanism to work. 4 Setup Identifier and Validation Optionally, you can also provide an endpoint which will be called to perform validation of the provided credentials. Its recommended to provide a GET API endpoint to perform validation, so as to avoid modifying any data using the credentials. 5 Extract Access Token & Refresh Token In the Auth Tokens Data section, you will provide the mapping using which the tokens can be extracted once received on callback on successful authorization. Usually an object is received after authorization which will be saved as access_token_response on Cobalt’s end and you need to provide the key mapping of the required fields from the object. Congratulations! You have successfully setup a OAuth 2.0 Custom Application in Cobalt. No Auth Select this option if no authentication is required for accessing the custom app. ​ Custom Actions for App Custom Apps support the addition of Actions of APIs. ​ Create Custom Action Select Custom Actions , click on the New Action button and provide a Name and Description . Add any required or optional Fields for the API and add the API under API Call section.

Navigation Examples Build NetSuite Integration Documentation Implementation & Guides API Reference SDKs Resources Cobalt home page v2 Postman Get Your API Key Examples Implementation Guide Get Started Integrate Communicate Test Integration Additional Deploy Examples Build Salesforce Integration Build NetSuite Integration Build Workday Integration Solutions 2 Way Data Sync Data Import Push Data to External Connector Examples Build NetSuite Integration In this guide, we will walk through the essential steps required to build a NetSuite integration using the Cobalt platform. This process involves three major steps i.e. User Authentication with NetSuite, Creating Workflows and Using workflows for users. ​ Authenticating with NetSuite integration To get started, first you need to enable the NetSuite integration in your account and also setup some basic processes. 1 Enable the NetSuite App Step 1: Enable the NetSuite App After setting up your account, the next step is to enable the NetSuite app in your Cobalt account. Apps cannot be enabled using the API. You will need to enable the app through the UI. To enable the NetSuite app: Navigate to Apps in Cobalt and search for Netsuite and enable the app by clicking on the Go Live button in the top right corner. Since this is a API Key based app, you do not need to perform any setup forn user authentication. Follow the steps given here to get your API credentials required for authentication. Once the app is enabled, you can proceed to create and manage workflows and linked accounts associated with NetSuite. 2 Create a Linked Account Step 2: Create a Linked Account A Linked Account in Cobalt represents the end-users or customers who will use the integration through the platform. Each Linked Account requires a unique linked_account_id, which typically corresponds to an ID from your internal data model (e.g., a user or account ID). Learn more about Linked Accounts here . To upsert (create or update) a Linked Account, use the following API call: Param Required Type Description linked_account_id Mandatory String Unique customer identifier name Optional String Name of the customer You can check the Linked Accounts in your Cobalt account by navigating to the Linked Accounts section in the side menu. Once the Linked Account is successfully created or updated, it will be ready for authentication in the next step. 3 Generate Session Token for your Linked Account Step 3: Generate Token After creating a Linked Account, the next step is to generate a session token. Session tokens help protect your Cobalt API key and manage end-customer tokens more securely. To create a session token, use the following API call: This session token will be included in subsequent requests to Cobalt APIs to authenticate and authorize the actions. 4 Open Hosted Portal Auth Flow Step 4: Open Hosted Portal Auth Flow Next, you will need to generate a Hosted URL that your users will use to authenticate with Salesforce. Cobalt securely stores the credentials and handles API calls on behalf of your users. Use the following API call to generate the Hosted URL: The response will return a Hosted URL that your users can visit to authenticate and connect their Salesforce accounts. Hosted Portal is a no-code solution provided by Cobalt that removes the need to build your own UI for handling integration authentication and configuration. 5 Authenticate Using Hosted Portal Step 5: Perform Key based Authentication Visit the Hosted URL provided in the API response. The Hosted Portal will display all the integrations you have enabled, including NetSuite. To authenticate: Navigate to the NetSuite integration in the portal. Provide the requested credentials. Click on Connect to begin successfully authenticate with NetSuite. You have successfully authenticated with NetSuite integration. The next step is to create workflows for your use-case. ​ Creating Workflows in NetSuite There are 2 major categories of workflows that you can create in NetSuite currently. Data Import from NetSuite Sync data from NetSuite to your system. Push Data to NetSuite Create data on NetSuite from your system. Let’s look at a sample workflow for each case. ​ Data Import from NetSuite Consider a use-case where you want to sync all the contacts present in NetSuite to your system. In the NetSuite integration, go to Workflows and create a new workflow by clicking on +Add Workflow button and name it as Sync Contacts . Data Import from NetSuite Follow the steps given to build the workflow: 1 Add Trigger in Start Node All workflows start with a trigger, which determines when the workflow will run and how data is passed into the workflow. For this workflow we will use the Event Based trigger. Learn more about the triggers and its types here . Click on the Start Node , select your native app option and click on + Create New Event . Give a name to your event and keep the payload as an empty object. 2 Add NetSuite Node Now to fetch all the contacts present in your user’s account, we need to call NetSuite API. Click on Nodes option in the top right and drag the NetSuite Node from Native Apps section to the workflow builder. Connect this node with Start Node and select Get Contact action in the node. 3 Add Custom Code node We fetched all the contacts data from NetSuite, but NetSuite API only sends the IDs of the contacts in the API response, so now we need to loop through all the IDs and get contact data. Drag the Custom Code from the Utility Nodes section onto the workflow builder and connect it with Salesforce node. 4 Mapping Contact fields Click on + Map Fields under Input Parameters, add key name as contacts and in value we will provide the response received through NetSuite node which will be restructured. In Value , select Nodes tab under Insert Variable and click on + of the NetSuite Node. You can now do mapping using JavaScript code. Try the sample code provided below: function yourFunction(params) { const res = params.contacts.map(ele=>{ const output = { id: ele.Id, title: ele.Name, description: ele.Description || 'Description not available', amount: ele.Amount, title: ele.Title, status: ele.StageName } return output }) return {\"result\": res || [] } } 5 API Proxy in Workflow You have successfully fetched all contacts and structured the payload. Now to receive it in your server, you need to configure an API Proxy. In Cobalt Dashboard, navigate to Developer > API Proxies and click on New Action . Configure an API endpoint, where you want to receive the response. If you want to test, go to webhook.site and copy Your unique URL and configure this as a POST Request and Save . Learn more about API Proxies here . 6 Use API Proxy in Workflow From Native Apps nodes, add your org’s Node and connect it with Custom Code. Click on the node and select the API Proxy that you created from the Actions. Add the response from Custom Code node in data field and click on Save . Ensure that you add a field in the API Proxy where you can pass the JSON data and then added it to the API Call body as well in the POST request. Hurray!! You have successfully created a NetSuite workflow to sync all the opportunities to your system. ​ Push Data to NetSuite Consider a use-case where you want to create a contact present in your system to NetSuite. This workflow will be fired when you send an Event with the payload of the contact to be added. In the NetSuite integration, go to Workflows and create a new workflow by clicking on +Add Workflow button and name it as Create New Contact . Push Data to NetSuite Follow the steps given to build the workflow: 1 Add Trigger in Start Node All workflows start with a trigger, which determines when the workflow will run and how data is passed into the workflow. For this workflow we will use the Event Based trigger. Learn more about the triggers and its types here . Click on the Start Node , select your native app option and click on + Create New Event . Give a name to your event and provide all the data related to the contact in the payload. 2 Add NetSuite Node Now to create a new contact in NetSuite, we need to call NetSuite API. Click on Nodes option in the top right and drag the NetSuite Node from Native Apps section to the workflow builder. Connect this node with Start Node. 3 Add Action in node Click on NetSuite Node and add the Create Contact action. To provide the data in all the fields from your Event payload, just click on a field and from the Event tab under Insert Variable, select the fields from the body that you sent as payload. Ensure that all the mandatory fields in the action are filled, else the NetSuite API will give error. Hurray!! You have successfully created a NetSuite workflow to create a new contact. You have successfully created the workflows for your use case. Next step is to enable and execute those workflows for your Linked Accounts. ​ Executing the Workflows To run these workflows for your users or Linked Accounts, you need to do the following steps: 1 Create Config for Linked Account Config is a customization that you store for each integration of your end-customers. Create Config You can create config for the Linked Account through the Cobalt Connect SDKs or using the APIs. You can use the .config() method or the Create Config API which returns the specified config or creates one if it doesn’t exist for the Linked Account. Make a request with the Application Slug and linked_account_id as mandatory fields for it. You can request in the following way: It will return information about config of the application for the Linked Account and provides you with all the published workflows and settings input for the user required to execute the workflow. Response { \"slug\" : \"netsuite\" , \"config_id\" : \"OPTIONAL_ID_FOR_THIS_CONFIG\" , \"fields\" : [ ] , \"workflows\" : [ { \"id\" : \"64d1fac58716dc5065127ffe\" , \"name\" : \"Sync Contacts\" , \"description\" : \"\" , \"enabled\" : false , \"fields\" : [ ] } ] , \"field_errors\" : [ ] } 2 Enable Workflow Now you need to enable the workflow for your Linked account. You can either ask the user to enable them or you can do so for them by using the Update Config API or .updateconfig() method. Make the following request: In response, you get the updated config information for the application. 3 Third Step Once the required workflows are enabled, you need to fire event to start execution. You can use the Trigger Event for app API with the following request: cURL curl -- request POST \\ -- url https : / / api . gocobalt . io / api / v2 / public / event / : slug \\ -- header 'Content-Type: application/json' \\ -- header 'linked_account_id: <linked_account_id>' \\ -- header 'x-api-key: <api-key>' \\ -- data ' { \"event\" : \"<string>\" , \"payload\" : { } } ' 4 Check Execution Logs Once the workflow execution has been fired, you can check the Logs of the workflow here . Learn more about logs and observability here . Congratulations!! You have successfully created a NetSuite integration and executed it for your users.

These actions, also referred to as API Proxies or Custom Actions , allows your organization to integrate their services better with the workflows in Cobalt. These actions serve as the building blocks for creating dynamic workflows, allowing users to automate processes and streamline operations across different applications integrated into the Cobalt ecosystem. ​ Creating an API Proxy To create an API Proxy in Cobalt, the user needs to provide specific information detailing the desired behavior of the action. This includes the following steps: ​ 1. Create Action Click on the New Action button and provide a Name and Description for the API Proxy. Click on the Create Action button. The API Proxy is created and the next step will be to configure it according to your needs. ​ 2. Configuring the API Proxy While configuring an API Proxy, there are 3 options that can be used to configure and make changes. The Basic Information option can be used to update the name or the description of the API proxy. Fields tab allows you to add and update fields for your Custom Action. These fields can be utilized to pass information between different steps within the workflow. And the API Call tab is used to define the API call to be executed upon triggering the action, Specify the endpoint, HTTP method, and any required request parameters. ​ 2.1 Adding a Field To add a new Field, click on the + icon in Fields . Provide information about the Field like Type of the field, Label , Placeholder , Description and whether the Field is Mandatory or not and click on Add Field . ​ 2.2 API Call Configuration Click and open the API Call section of API Proxy. Provide the API Request which needs to be executed in this Custom Action by providing the endpoint and selecting the Request Method. API Request or endpoint can also have variables in it which can be added to the URL by using curly brackets. Also provide other details for the API like Path or Query Params , Headers and any pre-request scripts and click on Save API Call . You can add variables or the fields created by you in API Proxy in the Body by clicking on the (x) icon ​ Utilizing the API Proxy in Workflows Once created, API Proxies can be used in workflows within Cobalt by using your Custom App present within Native Apps . This means that one Custom Action can be executed in several workflows. Users can define trigger conditions that initiate the execution of these actions, enabling automated responses to specific events and facilitating end-to-end process automation.

When creating application integrations, accessing customer’s data is a required step. Using Cobalt’s auth flows this process becomes both quick and heavily customizable. ​ Pre-requisites Below are a few pre-requisites that you need to do before choosing an Auth Flow: 1. Create Linked Account In order to enable your customer to connect to third party app, you first need to create a Linked account for them using a unique identifier. Know more about Linked Accounts and how you can create one in the guide here . We recommend you create a linked account at the same time as your customer signs up within your app. 2. Generate Session Token Generate a Session Token for your Linked Account. The session token gets expired in 24 hours. Please make sure you generate a new token in every new session or within 24 hours. ​ Auth flow integration options Cobalt provides 3 different ways for Auth flow of integrations ​ Hosted Flow Hosted flow Redirects user to Cobalt Connect hosted on `https://connect.gocobalt.io`. Hosted flow is a no-code solution, so you don’t need to build your own UI to handle the integration authentication. It handles the following features: List all enabled applications Handle the Auth flow Manage integration configuration for your end user. Dynamic field mapping feature is currently not supported in the Hosted auth flow. To get started, follow the 2 steps: 1 Generate Hosted URL To use Hosted flow, you will need to first get the hosted URL. This can be achieved by making a POST request to the Create Hosted URL API. Check out the Cobalt’s API Reference for more details. 2 Redirect to Hosted portal The generated URL can be then used to redirect the user to the Hosted UI, or can be embedded within your UI. Your user can select the application they want to connect and perform authentication. You can modify the UI of Hosted Portal using the hosted_properties . Property Description color Modify the theme color of Cobalt connect name Display name of your end customer bgColor Background Colour of your end customer ​ Embedded Flow (Cobalt Modals) Embedded Flow Utilize the React SDK and embed it seamlessly within your React application. Cobalt Embedded flow is a frontend SDK that allows you to embed Cobalt auth flow into your React application. It’s a simple process involving steps like Generate Session Token > Install and Initialise Frontend SDK and Render the Component . Learn more about Cobalt’s React SDK and how to initialize it here . For example implementation, you can check out the App.js file in the example directory. ​ Seamless Flow (Build your own Frontend) Seamless Flow Utilize our REST APIs and NodeJs SDK methods to implement and customize the authentication experience. Cobalt provides APIs and SDK functions that allow your customers to connect your platform with the third party applications. The general steps to build your own flow are: Display a list of integrations for your users to select Retrieve a list of all integrations available to connect using the List Applications API or .getApplications() method and display them in your UI. With the above call you can get all the details related to an appliction for a user. We recommend using the assets provided by Cobalt as they meet the requirements of the supported integrations. For example QuickBooks Online require the specific use of QuickBooks branded buttons, including specific hover states. Install and Initialise SDK Install the Cobalt Frontend SDK for JavaScript that you want to use. You can install by either using npm package manager or directly in browser by using the script tag. <!-- use a specific version --> < script src = \" https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@cobaltio/cobalt-js@3.0.1 \" > </ script > <!-- use a version range instead of a specific version --> < script src = \" https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@cobaltio/cobalt-js@3 \" > </ script > < script src = \" https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@cobaltio/cobalt-js@3.0 \" > </ script > <!-- omit the version completely to use the latest one --> <!-- you should NOT use this in production --> < script src = \" https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@cobaltio/cobalt-js \" > </ script > Initialize the javascript SDK using the Session token. Learn more about Cobalt’s JS SDK and how to initialize it here . Manage Connections Cobalt provides the flexibility for you to manage your customers’ application connections. The .connect() method lets your customers to connect to an application platform, authorizing you to access the platform APIs and data on their behalf. cobalt . connect ( \"slack\" ) // opens a new tab for oauth apps cobalt . connect ( \"twilio\" , { number : < \"Registered number\" > , sid : \"ACCOUNT_SID\" , } ) // saves the auth data for key based apps The .disconnect() method similarly, lets the user to disconnect from the application platform, revoking the authorization and deleting any and all configurations of the Linked account saved for that particular application. cobalt . disconnect ( \"slack\" ) Allow users to configure the connection Once the user has successfully authenticated in their platform, he is redirected back to your app integration page. Use the .config() method to find an exisiting config or creating a new config for the linked account. cobalt . config ( { slug : \"slack\" , config_id : \"OPTIONAL_ID_FOR_THIS_CONFIG\" , labels : { } , // optional dynamic labels } ) Save/Update the configuration The .config() method provides you with all the published workflows and settings input for the user. The user can now enable the workflows, enter data for the settings and map fields. These updates to the config can be made using the .updateConfig() method. cobalt . updateConfig ( { slug : \"slack\" , config_id : \"OPTIONAL_ID_FOR_THIS_CONFIG\" , fields : { \"64da0b57c9ae95561bb0a24d\" : \"C044U7Q074J\" } , workflows : [ { id : \"64d1fac58716dc5065127ffe\" , enabled : true , fields : { \"64da0b57c9ae95561bb0a24f\" : \"C044U7Q074J\" } } ] } ) ​ Authorization journey Cobalt lets you take the authorization for customer’s data in 3 simple steps: Open the auth flow portal for the customer using any of the above mentioned integration options. Customer provides consent or API Credentials for the respective app. Customer configures the data required for the connection, such as selecting specific integration settings. And done! Customer has now successfully connected the application(s) and can now make use of the published orchestrations.

Navigation Workflow API Documentation Implementation & Guides API Reference SDKs Resources Cobalt home page v2 Postman Get Your API Key Examples Developer Settings Overview Events API Proxy Platform Account Management Webhooks Tables by Cobalt Try API Workflow API The Workflow API in Cobalt allows users to execute workflows programmatically instead of relying on event-based triggers. This API-based execution provides flexibility in triggering workflows directly through an API call. ​ Setting up Workflow API as Trigger Let’s first see how you can setup a Workflow API for any of the workflows that you have in Cobalt. To set up a workflow to be triggered via the Workflow API: Navigate to the Start Node of the workflow. In the Start Node, select the API Call as the trigger method, make the required changes and click on Save . The API Call setup involves three fields: Workflow Alias (Optional) : This allows you to set a unique identifier for the workflow trigger. If used, this alias can replace the workflow ID in the API endpoint for executing the workflow. URL : The URL contains the endpoint for triggering the workflow. The format for this URL is . If you’ve set up a Workflow Alias, it can be used in place of the Workflow ID after /workflow/. Payload : Here, you define the JSON object or payload that contains the event data you want to send to the workflow. The variables set in the payload can be accessed within the workflow just like event payloads. You can leave this field as an empty object if no data needs to be passed. ​ Workflow API endpoints There are two APIs related to workflow execution: the /execute API and the /response API . ​ /execute API To execute a workflow, make a POST request to the workflow execution endpoint. If a Workflow Alias has been defined, you can replace workflow_id with the alias in the API. Send the event data in the request body, similar to how you would handle event payloads. If there is no payload, you can pass an empty JSON object . Request Headers linked_account_id : The Linked account for which you want to execute the workflow. Using Workflow API, the workflow gets executed even for those Linked Accounts who have not enabled the workflow. slug : Slug of the integration in which workflow is present. x-api-key : Your Cobalt API key sync_execution : By default, this is set to false , which means the API response will only include the execution_id . If you set sync_execution to true , the API response will include both the execution_id and the return_value object containing response as set in the Response node. sync_execution = true is not allowed if the workflow contains a Group Node. Sample cURL for Workflow Execute API: cURL curl --location --request POST 'https://api.gocobalt.io/api/v1/workflow/{workflow_id or alias}/execute' \\ --header 'content-type: application/json' \\ --header 'linked_account_id: john@acme.io' \\ --header 'slug: asana' \\ --header 'x-api-key: tkb5b9f358-4160-4fea-a926-cf52b271489d' \\ --header 'sync_execution: false' \\ --data ' { \"Task Name\" : \"Sample task\" , \"Created_at\" : \"2024-2-1\" , \"Assigned_to\" : \"John Doe\" } ' Response 200 { \"return_value\" : { \"success\" : \"true\" , \"new_note\" : \"This is the updated note content\" } , \"execution_id\" : \"66e404464f475f36c0c95b5d\" } ​ /response API To fetch the response received in a previously executed workflow, use the following API. Request Headers linked_account_id : The Linked account for which the workflow was executed. x-api-key : Your Cobalt API key Sample cURL for Execution Response API: cURL curl --location --request GET 'https://api.gocobalt.io/api/v1/execution/{execution_id}/response' \\ --header 'linked_account_id: john@acme.io' \\ --header 'x-api-key: tkb5b9f358-4160-4fea-a926-cf52b271489d' Response The API response will include the data set in the workflow’s Response node, as well as the status of the workflow, which can be one of the following: COMPLETED: The workflow has successfully finished. RUNNING: The workflow is still in progress. ERRORED: The workflow encountered an error. 200 { \"response\" : { \"success\" : \"true\" , \"new_note\" : \"This is the updated note content\" } , \"status\" : \"COMPLETED\" } The Workflow API provides a robust way to execute workflows programmatically in Cobalt. It allows greater flexibility in triggering workflows and retrieving responses, giving users control over workflow execution and monitoring via API. linkedin twitter Powered by Mintlify On this page Setting up Workflow API as Trigger Workflow API endpoints /execute API /response API"

Cobalt connect lets your users connect their integration accounts. It stores the credentials securely and lets you make authorized API calls on your users’ behalf (linked account in Cobalt). ​ Enable & Configure Apps To enable the apps that you want to use in Cobalt, go to the Apps page in the Cobalt dashboard. You will see a list of the available apps. Choose one or more apps to enable. The apps that you enable will become available to your users in the Connect flow. Key-based apps do not require any additional configuration. OAuth apps by default use Cobalt credentials. This makes it easy to get started and connect integrations right away. However, once you’re ready to ship your integrations with Cobalt, you should use your own OAuth app credentials (client ID and client secret). This will make sure that users see your brand instead of Cobalt when they connect integrations. You can find the App Setup instructions for some of the popular integrations that we support here . ​ Building Custom UI If you want to build a custom UI for your integrations, you can do so by using the Cobalt APIs or the Cobalt Connect SDK available in JavaScript and React. Cobalt API for UI If you want to create your own frontend for the integration and want to fetch information about the various integrations that will be available to the end-users, you can do so by using the List Applications API . Request : This API will list all the apps that were enabled above. Make a GET request to the /application endpoint with the linked_account_id of the user. cURL curl -- request GET \\ -- url https : / / api . gocobalt . io / api / v2 / public / application \\ -- header 'linked_account_id: <linked_account_id>' \\ -- header 'x-api-key: <api-key>' Handle Response : The /application endpoint will respond with an array containing the List of Applications that were enabled for the end-user.

Now that you have successfully created Linked Accounts for your end-users, it’s time to create Session Tokens for your clients. The token creation should always happen server side. Session tokens are used to protect your Cobalt API key and make it easier to manage your end customers’ tokens. When your client makes a request to the Cobalt APIs, it must include the session token in the request header. The Cobalt APIs will then use the session token to authenticate the request and grant access to the requested resources. To generate Session Token for a Linked Account, you can use the Cobalt API or Cobalt’s Client Side SDK. ​ Cobalt API/SDK for Session Token Request : In your server side code, make a POST Request to the /session-token endpoint or call the .getTokenForLinkedAccount() method of the NodeJS SDK . The request should include the linked-account_id of the user for which the Session token is to be generated. The session token gets expired in 24 hours. Please make sure you generate a new token in every new session or within 24 hours. Handle the response : Cobalt will respond with a JSON Object containing the token if request was successful. Parse the JSON response body and extract the token .

Implement a secure storage solution to store Session tokens and do not log or expose tokens to your frontend application. Handle Errors : If the /session-token endpoint returns a 500 error, your server-side code should handle it gracefully. The error is returned due to providing an incorrect linked_account_id while making the request. ​ Checkpoint + Next Step After completing this step, you now have the Session Token for your Linked Accounts.

This makes webhooks much more efficient and friendly. ​ Event Types Currently Cobalt 5 webhook event types: Connection Created A connection is created { \"linked_account_id\" : \"12345\" , \"org_id\" : \"645270e37917442c4307297a\" , \"environment\" : \"test\" , \"type\" : \"General\" , \"event\" : \"Connection Created\" , \"slug\" : \"hubspot\" , \"createdAt\" : \"Tue, 07 Nov 2023 08:03:27 GMT\" } Connection Deleted A connection is deleted { \"linked_account_id\" : \"12345\" , \"org_id\" : \"645270e37917442c4307297a\" , \"environment\" : \"test\" , \"type\" : \"General\" , \"event\" : \"Connection Deleted\" , \"slug\" : \"hubspot\" , \"createdAt\" : \"Tue, 07 Nov 2023 08:04:27 GMT\" } Connection Expired A connection is removed or does not exist { \"linked_account_id\" : \"12345\" , \"org_id\" : \"645270e37917442c4307297a\" , \"environment\" : \"test\" , \"type\" : \"General\" , \"event\" : \"Connection Expired\" , \"slug\" : \"pipedrive\" , \"createdAt\" : \"Tue, 07 Nov 2023 08:38:33 GMT\" } Workflow Completed Workflow has been successfully executed { \"linked_account_id\" : \"12345\" , \"instance_id\" : \"656f30f69144bb8f183c0118\" , \"workflow_id\" : \"6495792b9b6ca6d77a17e513\" , \"config_id\" : \"12345\" , \"event\" : \"Workflow Completed\" , \"workflow_name\" : \"Export contact to Hubspot\" , \"status\" : \"COMPLETED\" } Workflow Errored Workflow execution stopped because of an error { \"linked_account_id\" : \"12345\" , \"instance_id\" : \"656f308b9144bb8f183bfc7b\" , \"workflow_id\" : \"6495792b9b6ca6d77a17e513\" , \"config_id\" : \"12345\" , \"event\" : \"Workflow Errored\" , \"workflow_name\" : \"Export contact to Hubspot\" , \"status\" : \"ERRORED\" } ​ How to subscribe to webhook events?

You can create and update the events on Cobalt’s dashboard. Actions : Actions are your API end points on which Cobalt will send the data back. You can define the authorization method, list of parameters that your API will expect etc. on Cobalt’s dashboard auth_credentials : While creating a linked account using the createLinkedAccount() function, you can also pass auth_credentials of your end-customer. This will be later used while setting up ‘Actions’ and sending authorized requests on your end-points. App : An app represents a third-party data source that you can connect a customer to so that you can access the data in the respective application on behalf of the customer.

You can send data from your apps to other apps by using Cobalt Events . An event model contains name of the event and the trigger payload. The trigger payload contains sample data schema that can be used as data variables and are used inside a workflow as placeholders while defining the workflow. To learn more about Cobalt Events, you can refer to our guide here . ​ Create Event Follow these steps to create an Event in Cobalt: Create Event : Navigate to Developer in Cobalt > Events > Click on New Event > Select a Model > Update the sample Payload to your requirements > Click on Create Event . It is expected that you pass on the data as the Sample Payload while you are triggering this event. This is because, the properties defined in the sample payload can be used as trigger variables inside a workflow. ​ Trigger an Event You can trigger an event that was created in Cobalt by using the Trigger Event API . Request : Make a POST request to the /event/:slug endpoint. linked_account_id is a mandatory field to be passed while making the request. Request curl -- request POST \\ -- url https : / / api . gocobalt . io / api / v2 / public / event / : slug \\ -- header 'Content-Type: application/json' \\ -- header 'linked_account_id: <linked_account_id>' \\ -- header 'x-api-key: <api-key>' \\ -- data ' { \"event\" : \"<string>\" , \"payload\" : { \"first_name\" : \"Mark\" , \"last_name\" : \"wood\" , \"employee_id\" : 221 , \"is_new\" : false , \"address\" : { \"house_no\" : \"221\" , \"street\" : \"lorem ipsum\" , \"pincode\" : 560103 } } ' Param Required Type Description linked_account_id Mandatory String Unique customer identifier event Mandatory String Name of the event payload Optional Object Event payload with user data required for the workflow. Response : On a successful request, you will get a message that the event was triggered successfully. 200 { \"message\" : \"Webhook Fired Success\" } Handle Errors : If the /event/:slug endpoint returns a 400 error, your server-side code should handle it gracefully. The error is returned if you provided the wrong name of the event. 400 { \"status_code\" : 400 , \"error_type\" : \"BAD_REQUEST\" , \"message\" : \"Trigger with name Wrong_Event not found for application 646370324e3b114f9c720719\" , \"request_id\" : \"fa6ad809-3a6d-4c3d-9b86-c2c0662f3f37\" } ​ Checkpoint You have now created an event in Cobalt and can send data from your app to other third party apps or integrations enabled in Cobalt.

If you have followed the Implementation Guide completely, your application is ready for deployment. The following checklist is focused list of recommendations to validate that your application is ready for deployment. This will ensure a seamless experience for your customers, make your integration more robust and secure, and set you up for success when you launch into production. ​ Integrate Cobalt Auth flow Cobalt auth flows lets your users connect their integration accounts. It stores the credentials securely and lets you make authorized API calls on your users’ behalf. Integrate Cobalt auth flows into your application’s frontend. It should be displayed as a part of your onboarding flow, preferably behind an authentication login. Create Session Tokens for your linked accounts. Design a seamless connection experience Create a smooth frontend to display the integrations to your customers. Create a Linked Account for the user whenever he signs up to the platform. Display Auth text to your customer when they want to connect to an integration. If the application is key-based, provide them the instructions to get the API Key. ​ Configure Integration Configure the integration that you want to enable for your customers, correctly in the Cobalt Dashboard. Ensure that the correct Client ID and Client Secret are used in the OAuth app Setup. Check if the Callback URL provided by Cobalt has been added to your OAuth app. The scopes selected in the OAuth app should be correct for the actions that you want to perform. ​ Integrate Cobalt API or SDK Following steps are recommended to build a resilient integration using the API or SDK. Integrate the Cobalt APIs or SDKs for Listing Applications, Config etc. into your application’s backend. Handle Responses Parse through the response received and use the required fields from it. Handle Errors Your application should be able to handle errors you may receive from API Call or SDK Method call. Handle Re-Authentication of users if required for any application. ​ Workflows implementation It is necessary to ensure that the Workflows created for your users are logically optimal and are able to provide the required functionality. Ensure that the Workflow created is optimized and can provide the required functionality covering all the cases with minimum no. of nodes. Workflow Failures are properly handled on your platform. Check if the access of a workflow is provided to the required Linked accounts or not using the Access Control . Actions and Triggers of the Workflow For a workflow, it is essential that the correct information is read and write. The payload created in Events should be such that all the required information is available in it. The workflow should be able to provide proper information for the API Proxies to read . Testing Workflows All the nodes of a workflow should be tested and the errors should be handled. Orchestration testing will make sure that the Workflow is able to provide the required functionality. ​ Test the integration and go live Before going live, it is valuable to know the test scenarios for your Cobalt integration. An integration involves different test scenarios which should be thoroughly tested. Some integrations provide free Sandbox/trial accounts which should be used for testing before going live. ​ Support The following steps will ensure you and your team is set up for success once your Cobalt integration has gone live. You can contact Cobalt Support either by sending an email to integrations@gocobalt.io , or @Cobalt Support if you have a shared Slack channel with Cobalt.

You can only create a Persistent table when you create one using the New Table option in dashboard. It can be of two types: ​ Non-Persistent Table This type of Table and its data is available only within the context of the workflow execution in which it is created and cannot be accessed through Tables in dashboard. ​ Persistent Table This Table and its data can be accessed across all the workflows in any application. You can find the list of all Persistent Tables in your Cobalt dashboard. ​ Tables in dashboard All persistent tables created in the Cobalt platform can be accessed by navigating to Settings > Tables . This section provides details about each table, such as its ID and Name. Additionally, you can click on any Table to view and manage its records directly from this interface. ​ Table Actions Table node offers a range of actions which can be used in a Workflow: Create Table Users can create new Table within workflows, specifying its Type (Persistent or Non-Persistent) and defining the structure of the Table records. While using this action, the user is required to provide information like the Type , Name and the Columns for the Table. You can also create a Persistent table in the dashboard by clicking on the New Table option and then access it directly in the workflow. Delete Table Users have the option to delete existing Tables by providing the Table ID . Get Tables Users can retrieve a list of all Tables by providing the type of tables which they want to fetch. Add Table Record Users can add new records to a Table, by selecting the Table and then adding the required data. Search Table Records Users can search for specific records within a Table by searching for records based on any of the columns’ value. Get Table Records Users can retrieve all the records of a Table by providing its Table ID .

This API-based execution provides flexibility in triggering workflows directly through an API call. ​ Setting up Workflow API as Trigger Let’s first see how you can setup a Workflow API for any of the workflows that you have in Cobalt. To set up a workflow to be triggered via the Workflow API: 1 Navigation Navigate to the Start Node of the workflow. 2 Setup Workflow API In the Start Node, select the API Call as the trigger method, make the required changes and click on Save . The API Call setup involves three fields: Workflow Alias (Optional) : This allows you to set a unique identifier for the workflow trigger. If used, this alias can replace the workflow ID in the API endpoint for executing the workflow. URL : The URL contains the endpoint for triggering the workflow. The format for this URL is . If you’ve set up a Workflow Alias, it can be used in place of the Workflow ID after /workflow/. Payload : Here, you define the JSON object or payload that contains the event data you want to send to the workflow. The variables set in the payload can be accessed within the workflow just like event payloads. You can leave this field as an empty object if no data needs to be passed. ​ Workflow API endpoints There are two APIs related to workflow execution: the /execute API and the /response API . ​ /execute API To execute a workflow, make a POST request to the workflow execution endpoint. If a Workflow Alias has been defined, you can replace workflow_id with the alias in the API. Send the event data in the request body, similar to how you would handle event payloads. If there is no payload, you can pass an empty JSON object . Request Headers linked_account_id : The Linked account for which you want to execute the workflow. Using Workflow API, the workflow gets executed even for those Linked Accounts who have not enabled the workflow. slug : Slug of the integration in which workflow is present. x-api-key : Your Cobalt API key sync_execution : By default, this is set to false , which means the API response will only include the execution_id . If you set sync_execution to true , the API response will include both the execution_id and the return_value object containing response as set in the Response node. sync_execution = true is not allowed if the workflow contains a Group Node. Sample cURL for Workflow Execute API: cURL curl --location --request POST 'https://api.gocobalt.io/api/v1/workflow/{workflow_id or alias}/execute' \\ --header 'content-type: application/json' \\ --header 'linked_account_id: john@acme.io' \\ --header 'slug: asana' \\ --header 'x-api-key: tkb5b9f358-4160-4fea-a926-cf52b271489d' \\ --header 'sync_execution: false' \\ --data ' { \"Task Name\" : \"Sample task\" , \"Created_at\" : \"2024-2-1\" , \"Assigned_to\" : \"John Doe\" } ' Response 200 { \"return_value\" : { \"success\" : \"true\" , \"new_note\" : \"This is the updated note content\" } , \"execution_id\" : \"66e404464f475f36c0c95b5d\" } If sync_execution is set to true and any node has Skip Node on Error enabled, then Node Retry for that node is not allowed in case of a workflow error. ​ /response API To fetch the response received in a previously executed workflow, use the following API. Request Headers linked_account_id : The Linked account for which the workflow was executed. x-api-key : Your Cobalt API key Sample cURL for Execution Response API: cURL curl --location --request GET 'https://api.gocobalt.io/api/v1/execution/{execution_id}/response' \\ --header 'linked_account_id: john@acme.io' \\ --header 'x-api-key: tkb5b9f358-4160-4fea-a926-cf52b271489d' Response The API response will include the data set in the workflow’s Response node, as well as the status of the workflow, which can be one of the following: COMPLETED: The workflow has successfully finished. RUNNING: The workflow is still in progress. ERRORED: The workflow encountered an error. 200 { \"response\" : { \"success\" : \"true\" , \"new_note\" : \"This is the updated note content\" } , \"status\" : \"COMPLETED\" } Intro to Workflow Triggers Custom Code Node linkedin twitter Powered by Mintlify On this page Setting up Workflow API as Trigger Workflow API endpoints /execute API /response API"

Workflows consist of Triggers and Actions , allowing for seamless automation and data flow between applications. With Workflows, users can easily implement common integration use cases such as pushing data from their application to users’ apps, receiving real-time updates through webhooks, and enabling non-technical teams to configure integrations without coding. Here are some examples of Workflows for popular integrations: Slack Send notifications from your application to Slack channels. Salesforce Sync contacts from your application to Salesforce CRM. HubSpot Sync contacts between HubSpot and your application. Google Calendar Create events in Google Calendar based on events in your application. The Workflow Builder simplifies the integration process, empowering developers to create seamless and efficient data flows between applications with ease. ​ Triggers All workflows start with a trigger , which determines when the workflow will run and how data is passed into the workflow. Triggers are setup in the Start Node of workflow. Available workflow trigger types include: App Events App Events are custom events that are sent from your application via the Cobalt SDK or API to trigger Workflows. In general, App Events are useful for triggering workflows that map data from your application to your users’ apps. For example, you might send a Contact Created App Event from your application to trigger a Workflow that creates a matching contact in your users’ Salesforce CRM. An App Event can be used to trigger multiple workflows. This is useful in cases where you may want the same event to trigger similar workflows across different integrations. Learn more about Events in our guide here . Default App Triggers Default App triggers can be used to run workflows based on events in your users’ apps. For example, you might want to trigger a workflow whenever new contacts are created in your users’ Salesforce account, to sync contacts to your application in real-time. Schedule The Scheduler trigger is used for workflows that should run automatically at a scheduled time or interval. Minutes (e.g. every 30 minutes) Hourly (e.g. every hour at 15 minutes past the hour) Daily (e.g. every 2 days at 9:00 am) The minimum time that can be set in scheduler should be greater than 5 minutes. Once deployed, the workflow will run automatically at the designated time for all users who have activated the workflow. Workflow API The Workflow API in Cobalt allows users to execute workflows programmatically instead of relying on event-based triggers. This API-based execution provides flexibility in triggering workflows directly through an API call. Know more about Workflow API here . ​ Actions Workflow actions helps you to create complex workflows. You can drag and drop them on the workflow canvas as nodes of a workflow, inter-connect and configure them to achieve required flow. These actions can be broadly categorized as: Cobalt's Native actions These actions do not make any API calls themselves but help as utility tools for making workflows. There are various utility nodes currently provided by Cobalt. You can learn more about any of the node by clicking on its card below. Custom Code This action takes input parameters and uses them to manipulate the data using custom code. Delay Delay allows you to pause the execution of next step till a certain time. Loop This action is used to loop over an entity or a flow for a number of iterations. HTTP HTTP Node allows you to create an HTTP Request to any API of the integration. Internal Functions This action is used to create re-usable functions or use pre-defined library functions in the workflow. Merge The Merge Node allows you to merge multiple branches of a workflow into a single flow. PDF PDF node helps you to convert HTML to a PDF. Response Response node lets you notify you about the Subscribed Webhook events and define the data that needs to be sent to you along with the notification. Rule You can add conditional logic to workflows using our rule node. Send Email Send Email node lets you send an email through the workflow. Tables Tables node helps you create variables at runtime and add values to them. Transform This node lets you transform complex JSON into an easily accessible format. Cobalt's custom actions You can create API Proxies of your organization to use, in the Developer settings. Third party application actions Cobalt supports 100+ third party applications on its platform. Users can connect to these applications through Cobalt to make use of their APIs. When you select an application from the Apps list to create a workflow, you can find it’s Native node in the right panel along with the other actions. Drag and drop it on the workflow canvas to make use of the the application’s APIs supported by Cobalt. HTTP Request Users can also make any custom API call to the selected application that is not available with Cobalt as an action using the HTTP request. Simply setup the API in the node with all the required params like Method , URL , Request Body etc. and you are good to go.

In Cobalt, you can manage which users can access a workflow created by you. One of the primary tools for implementing access control is through User-Defined Function (UDF) parameters. UDF parameters empower users to filter configurations for Linked Accounts, thereby granting access to specific workflows only to authorized users or entities. Learn in detail about the UDF Parameter in our guide here . ​ Creating UDF Parameters In the Config Portal of a Workflow, users can set up Access conditions to control who can interact with the workflow. Please ensure that UDF Parameters on which the access will be controlled, have been created and set for the Linked Accounts. You can add UDF Parameters to the Linked Accounts either programmatically or by the UI of Cobalt. Using either the Upsert Linked Account API or .upsertLinkedAccount() method of the NodeJS SDK, you can add UDF parameter. Learn how to create UDF Parameter through the dashboard here . Param Required Type Description linked_account_id Mandatory String Unique customer identifier name Optional String Name of the customer UDF Optional Object User specific preliminary data your_app Optional Object Auth specific data The request upserts a Linked Account with the UDF Parameters as requested and gives the following Response Response { \"_id\" : \"65d5ba54d31e3880a27ebefd\" , \"associated_org\" : \"65c9ef72f4b95fce32e8ccf8\" , \"account_id\" : \"<Linked_account_id>\" , \"environment\" : \"test\" , \"name\" : \"John Doe\" , \"udf\" : [ { \"key_name\" : \"Role\" , \"key_value\" : \"Member\" , \"_id\" : \"660bd08b01d2ef85025d707c\" , \"updatedAt\" : \"2024-04-02T09:31:55.647Z\" , \"createdAt\" : \"2024-04-02T09:31:55.647Z\" } , { \"key_name\" : \"Title\" , \"key_value\" : \"Sr. Developer\" , \"_id\" : \"660bd08b01d2ef85025d707d\" , \"updatedAt\" : \"2024-04-02T09:31:55.647Z\" , \"createdAt\" : \"2024-04-02T09:31:55.647Z\" } ] , \"createdAt\" : \"2024-02-21T08:54:44.607Z\" , \"updatedAt\" : \"2024-04-02T09:31:55.647Z\" , \"__v\" : 34 } ​ Configuring Access Controls To configure the Access Controls, go to the Workflow in Cobalt for which you want to do so. Click on the Config Portal button in the top right of the workflow. Here you have the option to define Access conditions such as Match all conditions or Match any condition . Users can then specify the name of the UDF parameter and its corresponding value that should be allowed to access the Workflow. This workflow will now be visible only to the Linked Accounts which satsify the Access Control conditions.

When creating application integrations, accessing customer’s data is a required step. Using Cobalt’s auth flows this process becomes both quick and heavily customizable. ​ Pre-requisites Below are a few pre-requisites that you need to do before choosing an Auth Flow: 1. Create Linked Account In order to enable your customer to connect to third party app, you first need to create a Linked account for them using a unique identifier. Know more about Linked Accounts and how you can create one in the guide here . We recommend you create a linked account at the same time as your customer signs up within your app. 2. Generate Session Token Generate a Session Token for your Linked Account. The session token gets expired in 24 hours. Please make sure you generate a new token in every new session or within 24 hours. ​ Auth flow integration options Cobalt provides 3 different ways for Auth flow of integrations Hosted flow Redirects user to Cobalt Connect hosted on `https://connect.gocobalt.io`. Hosted flow is a no-code solution, so you don’t need to build your own UI to handle the integration authentication. It handles the following features: List all enabled applications Handle the Auth flow Manage integration configuration for your end user. Dynamic field mapping feature is currently not supported in the Hosted auth flow. To get started, follow the 2 steps: 1 Generate Hosted URL To use Hosted flow, you will need to first get the hosted URL. This can be achieved by making a POST request to the Create Hosted URL API. Check out the Cobalt’s API Reference for more details. 2 Redirect to Hosted portal The generated URL can be then used to redirect the user to the Hosted UI, or can be embedded within your UI. Your user can select the application they want to connect and perform authentication. You can modify the UI of Hosted Portal using the hosted_properties . Property Description color Modify the theme color of Cobalt connect name Display name of your end customer bgColor Background Colour of your end customer Embedded Flow Utilize the React SDK and embed it seamlessly within your React application. Cobalt Embedded flow is a frontend SDK that allows you to embed Cobalt auth flow into your React application. It’s a simple process involving steps like Generate Session Token > Install and Initialise Frontend SDK and Render the Component . Learn more about Cobalt’s React SDK and how to initialize it here . For example implementation, you can check out the App.js file in the example directory. Seamless Flow Utilize our REST APIs and NodeJs SDK methods to implement and customize the authentication experience. Cobalt provides APIs and SDK functions that allow your customers to connect your platform with the third party applications. The general steps to build your own flow are: Display a list of integrations for your users to select Retrieve a list of all integrations available to connect using the List Applications API or .getApplications() method and display them in your UI. With the above call you can get all the details related to an appliction for a user. We recommend using the assets provided by Cobalt as they meet the requirements of the supported integrations. For example QuickBooks Online require the specific use of QuickBooks branded buttons, including specific hover states. Install and Initialise SDK Install the Cobalt Frontend SDK for JavaScript that you want to use. You can install by either using npm package manager or directly in browser by using the script tag. <!-- use a specific version --> < script src = \" https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@cobaltio/cobalt-js@3.0.1 \" > </ script > <!-- use a version range instead of a specific version --> < script src = \" https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@cobaltio/cobalt-js@3 \" > </ script > < script src = \" https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@cobaltio/cobalt-js@3.0 \" > </ script > <!-- omit the version completely to use the latest one --> <!-- you should NOT use this in production --> < script src = \" https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@cobaltio/cobalt-js \" > </ script > Initialize the javascript SDK using the Session token. Learn more about Cobalt’s JS SDK and how to initialize it here . Manage Connections Cobalt provides the flexibility for you to manage your customers’ application connections. The .connect() method lets your customers to connect to an application platform, authorizing you to access the platform APIs and data on their behalf. cobalt . connect ( \"slack\" ) // opens a new tab for oauth apps cobalt . connect ( \"twilio\" , { number : < \"Registered number\" > , sid : \"ACCOUNT_SID\" , } ) // saves the auth data for key based apps The .disconnect() method similarly, lets the user to disconnect from the application platform, revoking the authorization and deleting any and all configurations of the Linked account saved for that particular application. cobalt . disconnect ( \"slack\" ) Allow users to configure the connection Once the user has successfully authenticated in their platform, he is redirected back to your app integration page. Use the .config() method to find an exisiting config or creating a new config for the linked account. cobalt . config ( { slug : \"slack\" , config_id : \"OPTIONAL_ID_FOR_THIS_CONFIG\" , labels : { } , // optional dynamic labels } ) Save/Update the configuration The .config() method provides you with all the published workflows and settings input for the user. The user can now enable the workflows, enter data for the settings and map fields. These updates to the config can be made using the .updateConfig() method. cobalt . updateConfig ( { slug : \"slack\" , config_id : \"OPTIONAL_ID_FOR_THIS_CONFIG\" , fields : { \"64da0b57c9ae95561bb0a24d\" : \"C044U7Q074J\" } , workflows : [ { id : \"64d1fac58716dc5065127ffe\" , enabled : true , fields : { \"64da0b57c9ae95561bb0a24f\" : \"C044U7Q074J\" } } ] } ) ​ Authorization journey Cobalt lets you take the authorization for customer’s data in 3 simple steps: Open the auth flow portal for the customer using any of the above mentioned integration options. Customer provides consent or API Credentials for the respective app. Customer configures the data required for the connection, such as selecting specific integration settings. And done! Customer has now successfully connected the application(s) and can now make use of the published orchestrations.

Cobalt supports 2 types of Authentication: Key-based and OAuth 2.0 which you can check by navigating to your integration in Apps > Settings of the integration. For Key-Based If the integration is key-based, you would require your own API key and other credentials to authenticate with the integration and test it. To get your credentials, click on Read Documentation button present under Overview of the integration. If you are unable to find the steps of how you can get those API credentials, please contact us and we will provide the steps to you. OAuth Based If the integration is OAuth 2.0, then you will need to provide credentials of your app like Client ID and Client Secret OR you can also use our OAuth app credentials by choosing Use Our Credentials option. Follow these steps to configure your credentials: Navigate to the Overview in the integration > Click on Read documentation and you will be redirected to the OAuth app Setup doc for the respective integration. Create your integration credentials by following the setup guide, such as Client ID and Secret and add it in Settings and click on Save . For certain integrations like DocuSign, if your developer app isn’t published, you won’t be able to authenticate an account outside the developer environment. Alternatively, you can request us for a Demo account credentials for testing purposes. ​ Step 2: Workflow Setup Once your credentials are configured, you can also check the demo workflows already set in your account by navigating to Workflows in the integration. ​ Step 3: Set Up API Proxy In most integrations where you want to fetch some data, you’ll need to setup API proxy to capture workflow’s final response during testing. It’s not necessary that every workflow will have an API Proxy present, in that case you can skip this step. Learn more about API Proxy here . Follow the steps given below to setup your own URL where you can receive the response: Navigate to the workflow for which you want to configure your URL to receive the response. In the workflow, check the Native node present at the end of the workflow path and see the name of the Action that is present in that node. For eg: In the image above, the name of the API Proxy or Action present is Bulk Create Contacts . To get your own URL for setup, go to webhook.site and copy Your unique URL . In Cobalt, navigate to Developers > API Proxies > Search for the Action name that was setup in the workflow > Select it and paste the unique URL you copied under Request URL present in API Call and click on Save API Call . ​ Step 4: Authenticate Linked Account Next step is to perform authentication of a Linked Account to the integration, to link it to the workflow. Linked Accounts refers to the end-users or customers of our users who utilize the integrations built using the Cobalt platform. Go to Linked Accounts section in Cobalt and open any Linked Account present. You can also create a new linked account if you want by clicking on + Add Account button in the top right. Click on Get Hosted URL button > Generate Hosted URL > Copy the URL shown and open it in a new tab. Hosted Portal is a no-code solution built by Cobalt so that you don’t need to build your own UI to handle the integration authentication and configuration which we will now use for testing purposes. You can also build your own UI for end-users using our SDKs or APIs and Auth Flows . In the Hosted portal, navigate to the integration for which you want to perform authentication. If it’s OAuth simply click on Connect or provide credentials if it’s Key-based and click on Connect . If the authentication is successful you should see a Connected tag displayed beside the integration name. Next, enable the workflows which you want to test for the integration and click on Save . If the authentication was not successful, please ensure that all the steps in Setup doc of the integration were followed correctly. ​ Step 5: Test the Setup Now that everything is set up, you can proceed to test the workflow. Trigger of a Workflow can either be: Native App Trigger which triggers when a certain action is performed in the application. For eg: If the Contact Created trigger of HubSpot is present in the Start Node of your workflow, then it triggers when a new contact is added to your HubSpot account. Event based triggers which triggers when an event is called on Cobalt. You can check which Event is added to the workflow by checking the Start Node of the workflow. To start the workflow execution, go to Try API section in Cobalt, provide the required details and click on Fire Event . Once the Event is fired, you can see the Event and Execution logs of your workflow by navigating to Logs section. Also, if the workflow executed successfully, you can check the final response received on your webhook.site . Hurray! You have successfully completed setup for an integration and also executed the workflow to receive the final response. ​ Go Deeper and Explore Cobalt This was a simple overview to setup native integrations using Cobalt, and how Linked Accounts and workflows interact within the platform.

Navigation App Config Mapping Documentation Guides API Reference SDKs Resources Cobalt home page v1 Postman Get Your API Key Examples Documentation Introduction Quickstart Glossary Implementation Guide Get Started Integrate Communicate Test Integration Additional Deploy Concepts Linked Accounts Auth Flows Logs Workflow App Config How To Configure Mapping Dependent Field Types Integrations Custom Apps App Config Mapping Data mapping comes as a crucial feature when you want your users to map their application platform’s fields to your fields in order to make sure the correct data is being synced from the platform and vice versa. Such can be mappings can be either static or dynamic depending upon your use case. In either case, you’d have to create a Map-type dataslot setting in your application or workflow configuration settings in Cobalt. A Map-type dataslot is a type of User Setting that allows your users to define a mapping between an object in your application (an “Application Object”) and an object in their connected integration account (an “Integration Object”). ​ Static mapping Static mapping essentially means that you have a set of pre-defined fields for which you want your users to map the respective application fields. User can create the required labels in the configuration pages specific to a workflow or the application itself in the cobalt dashboard. . On setting the static map-type dataslot, the config returns the application fields along with the created labels. These labels consist of the name provided by you and system generated static value. This value is mapped to the application platform fields. \"fields\" : [ { \"required\" : false , \"id\" : \"65a0ee61b542ff4a62fe68b9\" , \"name\" : \"Map Deal Fields\" , \"field_type\" : \"map\" , \"options\" : [ { \"name\" : \"HubSpot Campaign\" , \"value\" : \"hs_campaign\" } , { \"name\" : \"Closed Won Date (Internal)\" , \"value\" : \"hs_closed_won_date\" } , { \"name\" : \"Global Term Line Item Discount Percentage\" , \"value\" : \"hs_line_item_global_term_hs_discount_percentage\" } , ... ] , \"labels\" : [ { \"name\" : \"Name\" , \"value\" : \"65a0ef4db542ff4a62fe6a0c\" } , { \"name\" : \"Amount\" , \"value\" : \"65a0ef4db542ff4a62fe6a0d\" } , { \"name\" : \"Request ID\" , \"value\" : \"65a0ef4db542ff4a62fe6a0e\" } ] , \"multiple\" : false , \"hidden\" : false } ] Next time when you’d like to update the value of the mapped field with some data, send the data against the system generated value . ​ Dynamic mapping Scenarios where the fields cannot be pre-defined for mapping and changes dynamically cannot be mapped using static mapping. For this Cobalt provides a feature To map your labels dynamically while creating your config. To do so, instead of creating the labels in the configuration pages specific to a workflow or the application, simply toggle the Dynamic option of the data slot and provide the Labels Object Name . . Now while creating the config using .config() method, pass on the required dynamic labels under the created Labels Object Name . Check out this documentation for more details. cobalt . config ( { slug : \"hubspot\" , config_id : \"OPTIONAL_ID_FOR_THIS_CONFIG\" , labels : { \"Contact Fields\" : [ { \"name\" : \"First Name\" , \"value\" : \"first_name\" } , { \"name\" : \"Registration id\" , \"value\" : \"r_t353553gq12\" } ] } } ) Note here that unlike static mapping, the label value here is not system generated but defined by the user. ​ Getting map-type config from frontend SDK Use the config() function to get the config of a particular app. cobalt.config('mailerlite','configid'); Let’s look at a sample response of map-type dataslot. As you can see, the previously empty ‘labels’ array now has the options configured above on the platform - ‘Name’ and ‘Email’. { \"application_data_slots\" : [ { \"required\" : true , \"id\" : \"645df2f8e77af6ed8d02f32f\" , \"name\" : \"Map Mailerlite Fields\" , \"has_dynamic_map_fields\" : false , \"field_type\" : \"map\" , \"options\" : [ { \"name\" : \"City\" , \"value\" : \"city\" } , { \"name\" : \"Company\" , \"value\" : \"company\" } , { \"name\" : \"Country\" , \"value\" : \"country\" } , { \"name\" : \"Last name\" , \"value\" : \"last_name\" } , { \"name\" : \"Name\" , \"value\" : \"name\" } , { \"name\" : \"Phone\" , \"value\" : \"phone\" } , { \"name\" : \"Secondary_Email\" , \"value\" : \"secondary_email\" } , { \"name\" : \"State\" , \"value\" : \"state\" } , { \"name\" : \"Zip\" , \"value\" : \"z_i_p\" } ] , \"dynamic_slot_identifier\" : \"dynamic:mailerlite:1\" , \"labels\" : [ { \"name\" : \"Name\" , \"value\" : \"645df30fe77af6ed8d02f338\" } , { \"name\" : \"Email\" , \"value\" : \"645df30fe77af6ed8d02f339\" } ] } ] , \"workflows\" : [ ] , \"config_id\" : \"1234\" } ​ Updating value of map-type config Use the updateConfig() function to save the selected value. In this case an object with respective labels and their values will be needed to pass. cobalt . updateConfig ( 'pipedrive' , '1234' , { \"config_id\" : \"1234\" , \"application_data_slots\" : { \"645df2f8e77af6ed8d02f32f\" : { \"645df30fe77af6ed8d02f339\" : \"secondary_email\" , \"645df30fe77af6ed8d02f338\" : \"name\" } /*[response.application_data_slots[0].id] : { [ response . application_data_slots [ 0 ] . labels [ 0 ] . value ] : response . application_data_slots [ 0 ] . options [ 4 ] . value [ response . application_data_slots [ 0 ] . labels [ 1 ] . value ] : response . application_data_slots [ 0 ] . options [ 6 ] . value } * / } , \"workflows\" : [ ] } ) ; It will return the same response as config() functions with updates in the changed value. You will notice that the value is now added in the object. { \"application_data_slots\" : [ { \"required\" : true , \"id\" : \"645df2f8e77af6ed8d02f32f\" , \"name\" : \"Map Mailerlite Fields\" , \"has_dynamic_map_fields\" : false , \"field_type\" : \"map\" , \"options\" : [ { \"name\" : \"City\" , \"value\" : \"city\" } , { \"name\" : \"Company\" , \"value\" : \"company\" } , { \"name\" : \"Country\" , \"value\" : \"country\" } , { \"name\" : \"Last name\" , \"value\" : \"last_name\" } , { \"name\" : \"Name\" , \"value\" : \"name\" } , { \"name\" : \"Phone\" , \"value\" : \"phone\" } , { \"name\" : \"Secondary_Email\" , \"value\" : \"secondary_email\" } ] , \"dynamic_slot_identifier\" : \"dynamic:mailerlite:1\" , \"labels\" : [ { \"name\" : \"Name\" , \"value\" : \"645df30fe77af6ed8d02f338\" } , { \"name\" : \"Email\" , \"value\" : \"645df30fe77af6ed8d02f339\" } ] , \"value\" : { \"645df30fe77af6ed8d02f339\" : \"secondary_email\" , \"645df30fe77af6ed8d02f338\" : \"name\" } } ] , \"workflows\" : [ ] , \"config_id\" : \"1234\" } How To Configure Dependent linkedin twitter Powered by Mintlify On this page Static mapping Dynamic mapping Getting map-type config from frontend SDK Updating value of map-type config"

These custom apps function similarly to other pre-built integrations available in Cobalt, allowing users to tailor their automation processes according to their specific needs. ​ Creating Custom Apps Custom Apps can be created within the Apps section of Cobalt, alongside other available integrations. When creating a custom app, users have the option to specify various details such as the Name , Category , Description and Slug to identify the app within the Cobalt platform. Custom App will also have a tag Custom written on their card in the App list. Learn in detail about how you can create a Custom App in Cobalt here . ​ Authentication Methods Custom Apps support multiple authentication methods. To setup the Authorization for the Custom App, navigate to Authorization in the App and choose the desired method. The methods of Authorization are: ​ Key Based If the Custom App requires API Key based authentication, select Key Based . It requires users to set up an API for generating access tokens. ​ OAuth 1.0 If the App requires OAuth 1.0 auth, select Oauth1 . It requires the user to provide information like Auth token API , Token Type , Token Field name etc. ​ OAuth 2.0 If you want to provide OAuth 2.0 type authorization, select OAuth 2.0 in the methods. Users need to provide details such as Client ID , Client ID Param Name , Client Secret , Redirect URL , Auth and Token URLs , Scopes etc., along with the API for acquiring the access token. ​ No Auth Select this option if no authentication is required for accessing the custom app. ​ App Configuration Similar to the pre-built integrations on Cobalt, users can configure various aspects in the Custom App, including Actions , Workflows , and App-specific configurations. App configuration allows users to fine-tune the behavior of the custom app according to their requirements. ​ Adding Actions and Workflows Custom Apps support the addition of Actions and Workflows, enabling users to define specific tasks and automation processes within the app. Actions can be created to perform specific functions or interact with external systems similar to the API Proxy in Cobalt, while Workflows allow users to orchestrate a series of actions to achieve complex automation scenarios.

This essentially means that users can use these variables in their application workflows and API Proxies and authorization settings . Using these templates, users can access data from previous nodes in workflows and end-users UDF . The templates are keywords enclosed within double-curly braces {{}} , with specific use cases. Cobalt dynamic variables and their templating can be broadly categorized as: ​ 1. Workflow dynamic variables Workflow dynamic variables are used to access data from previous nodes. Every node in a workflow returns some data in the form of a response object. Data from a node can be accessed either directly from the response object using a template or by accessing as variables generated through test execution of nodes: Access using template The following template is used within Cobalt to access the response object of any other node in the workflow: {{node.<node number>.response:<Response object property>}} OR {{node.<node number>.response}} , if one wishes to access the complete response object. For example, one can access the first item of response from node 15. It can be accessed as: {{node.15.response:0}} . Or if one wants to access the “name” field of the item, it can be accessed as {{node.15.response:0.name}} . Access using Test Run variables In Cobalt workflows, you can use variables generated from tested node responses to access data dynamically. To use variables generated from node test runs, ensure that the workflow testing pre-requisites are satisfied and you have run a test execution on the node whose response you want to access. Learn more about Workflow Testing and it’s pre-requisites here . Now follow the steps given below to use these variables: 1 Select the node Go to the node where you want to use the variable and click on the input field where the variable is needed. 2 Choose the node with required response From the Insert Variable modal, select the Nodes tab and click on the down facing arrow button to expand the node response. In this example, we used the id received in the response when project was created and it’s visible as 4.id in the field which is of the format <node_number>.<response_field> . 3 Response not available If the selected node doesn’t have resonse as variables, then you need to click on Run node to perform a test execution of that node. If the structure of the response object changes of a node (e.g., due to a different input payload), simply perform another test run on the node with the modified payload. The updated response structure will now be available for use as variables in other nodes. ​ 2. Instance metadata variables An instance refers to a workflow execution instance. A workflow or an API proxy can access various instance data on the run-time such as, Event name - {{instance_meta_data.event_name}} Config id - {{instance_meta_data.config_id}} Start time of the execution / Instance creation - {{instance_meta_data.instance_created_time}} Instance id - {{instance_meta_data.instance_id}} ​ 3. Linked account variables Linked account variables are used to pass on Linked account-specific data throughout the Cobalt platform. The following are the variables that be used on the execution runtime: UDFs - {{linked_account.udf.<UDF property>}} Authorization data - {{linked_account.auth_credentials.<auth properties>}} Workflow Testing Dataslots linkedin twitter Powered by Mintlify On this page Overview 1.

If you have followed the Implementation Guide completely, your application is ready for deployment. The following checklist is focused list of recommendations to validate that your application is ready for deployment. This will ensure a seamless experience for your customers, make your integration more robust and secure, and set you up for success when you launch into production. ​ Integrate Cobalt Auth flow Cobalt auth flows lets your users connect their integration accounts. It stores the credentials securely and lets you make authorized API calls on your users’ behalf. Integrate Cobalt auth flows into your application’s frontend. It should be displayed as a part of your onboarding flow, preferably behind an authentication login. Create Session Tokens for your linked accounts. Design a seamless connection experience Create a smooth frontend to display the integrations to your customers. Create a Linked Account for the user whenever he signs up to the platform. Display Auth text to your customer when they want to connect to an integration. If the application is key-based, provide them the instructions to get the API Key. ​ Configure Integration Configure the integration that you want to enable for your customers, correctly in the Cobalt Dashboard. Ensure that the correct Client ID and Client Secret are used in the OAuth app Setup. Check if the Callback URL provided by Cobalt has been added to your OAuth app. The scopes selected in the OAuth app should be correct for the actions that you want to perform. ​ Integrate Cobalt API or SDK Following steps are recommended to build a resilient integration using the API or SDK. Integrate the Cobalt APIs or SDKs for Listing Applications, Config etc. into your application’s backend. Handle Responses Parse through the response received and use the required fields from it. Handle Errors Your application should be able to handle errors you may receive from API Call or SDK Method call. Handle Re-Authentication of users if required for any application. ​ Workflows implementation It is necessary to ensure that the Workflows created for your users are logically optimal and are able to provide the required functionality. Ensure that the Workflow created is optimized and can provide the required functionality covering all the cases with minimum no. of nodes. Workflow Failures are properly handled on your platform. Check if the access of a workflow is provided to the required Linked accounts or not using the Access Control . Actions and Triggers of the Workflow For a workflow, it is essential that the correct information is read and write. The payload created in Events should be such that all the required information is available in it. The workflow should be able to provide proper information for the API Proxies to read . Testing Workflows All the nodes of a workflow should be tested and the errors should be handled. Orchestration testing will make sure that the Workflow is able to provide the required functionality. ​ Test the integration and go live Before going live, it is valuable to know the test scenarios for your Cobalt integration. An integration involves different test scenarios which should be thoroughly tested. Some integrations provide free Sandbox/trial accounts which should be used for testing before going live. ​ Support The following steps will ensure you and your team is set up for success once your Cobalt integration has gone live. You can contact Cobalt Support either by sending an email to integrations@gocobalt.io , or @Cobalt Support if you have a shared Slack channel with Cobalt.

Look at the below example to set a new config dataslot. ​ Handling multiple configs Handling multiple configs is an advanced feature for users who want to store and run different configs for a single workflow. To do so, we need to set a unique id while calling the config() and updateConfig() functions. ​ Step 1: Setting a unique config id You can set a unique config while calling the .config() function as shown below. Make sure that config ids are stored on your end. cobalt . config ( 'pipedrive' , 'configid-1' ) ; //creating a config using an id 'configid-1' cobalt . config ( 'pipedrive' , 'configid-2' ) ; //creating a config using another id 'configid-2' Similarly, while calling the updateConfig() function make sure that you also use the respective config id. ​ Step 2: Using Config id while triggering events While triggering a new event from the backend SDK, you need to pass the respective config id to use the stored value inside the config. // Send the \"New Contact Created\" App Event try { const data = await Client . event ( { linked_account_id : \"<Account Id of the user eg: example@someemail.com>\" , event : \"New Contact Created\" , config_id : \"configid-2\" , //event will trigger a workflow using configid-2 payload : { \"name\" : \"Jeff Atwood\" , \"email\" : \"jeff@stackoverflow.com\" , \"phone\" : \"4151231234\" , \"company\" : \"Stack Overflow\" , \"role\" : \"Founder\" } } ) } catch ( error ) { //Catch any error } Transform Node Mapping linkedin twitter Powered by Mintlify On this page Create config dataslots on Cobalt’s platform Handling multiple configs Step 1: Setting a unique config id Step 2: Using Config id while triggering events"

This will help you achieve greater reliability, accuracy, and performance after launch. In this guide, we’ll help you build a testing plan to identify potential issues early and ensure that your application is working effectively. ​ 1. Develop comprehensive test scenarios Create a testing plan that outlines various scenarios, edge cases, and expected outcomes for your integration in Cobalt. Include both successful and unsuccessful cases, such as proper handling of errors types. Ensure that your test plan covers all relevant aspects of your Cobalt API integration, including authorization, API requests, data processing, and data storage. ​ 2. Writing Automated tests Leverage automated testing tools and frameworks to run your tests and validate common and uncommon API or method call responses. Automated testing will help you identify any issues or inconsistencies (like empty data fields or config) in your integration, and allow you to quickly address them before deploying your application to production. Regularly update your test cases as your integration involves more workflows to ensure comprehensive coverage: How does your application respond when a user needs to be reauthenticated? Learn more about How to handle ReAuth in Cobalt in our Additional section. How is a user properly disconnected from the integration? ​ 3. Perform manual testing of Cobalt auth flows In addition to automated tests, perform manual testing of the frontend Cobalt auth flow to validate its proper functionality and desired user experience. This may include end-to-end testing, where you simulate a user’s interaction with your application and verify that the integration connects correctly and subsequent API calls are initiated. What happens after Cobalt Connect closes after a successful connection? Where does the user go next? What happens after Cobalt Connect modal closes unsuccessfully (like invalid user credentials)? ​ 4. Conduct regular reviews Periodically review your Cobalt integration to ensure it continues to meet your application’s needs and performance requirements. Look for opportunities to optimize your integration, such as refining your workflows, improving error handling, or exploring new Cobalt integrations. ​ Checkpoint + Next Step After completing this step, you now have a robust and reliable integration on your end that meets the needs of your users.

This essentially means that users can use these variables in their application workflows and API Proxies and authorization settings . Using these templates, users can access data from previous nodes in workflows and end-users UDF . The templates are keywords enclosed within double-curly braces {{}} , with specific use cases. Cobalt dynamic variables and their templating can be broadly categorized as: ​ 1. Workflow dynamic variables Workflow dynamic variables are used to access data from previous nodes. Every node in a workflow returns some data in the form of a response object. Data from a node can be accessed either directly from the response object using a template or by accessing as variables generated through test execution of nodes: Access using template The following template is used within Cobalt to access the response object of any other node in the workflow: {{node.<node number>.body.<Response object property>}} OR {{node.<node number>.body}} , if one wishes to access the complete response object. For example, one can access the first item of response from node 15. It can be accessed as: {{node.15.body.0}} . Or if one wants to access the “name” field of the item, it can be accessed as {{node.15.response:0.name}} . Access using Test Run variables In Cobalt workflows, you can use variables generated from tested node responses to access data dynamically. To use variables generated from node test runs, ensure that the workflow testing pre-requisites are satisfied and you have run a test execution on the node whose response you want to access. Learn more about Workflow Testing and it’s pre-requisites here . Now follow the steps given below to use these variables: 1 Select the node Go to the node where you want to use the variable and click on the input field where the variable is needed. 2 Choose the node with required response From the Insert Variable modal, select the Nodes tab and click on the down facing arrow button to expand the node response. In this example, we used the id received in the response when project was created and it’s visible as 4.id in the field which is of the format <node_number>.<response_field> . 3 Response not available If the selected node doesn’t have resonse as variables, then you need to click on Run node to perform a test execution of that node. If the structure of the response object changes of a node (e.g., due to a different input payload), simply perform another test run on the node with the modified payload. The updated response structure will now be available for use as variables in other nodes. ​ 2. Instance metadata variables An instance refers to a workflow execution instance. A workflow or an API proxy can access various instance data on the run-time such as, Event name - {{instance_meta_data.event_name}} Config id - {{instance_meta_data.config_id}} Start time of the execution / Instance creation - {{instance_meta_data.instance_created_time}} Instance id - {{instance_meta_data.instance_id}} ​ 3. Linked account variables Linked account variables are used to pass on Linked account-specific data throughout the Cobalt platform. The following are the variables that be used on the execution runtime: UDFs - {{linked_account.udf.<UDF property>}} Authorization data - {{linked_account.auth_credentials.<auth properties>}} Workflow Testing Data Refs linkedin twitter Powered by Mintlify On this page Overview 1.

To setup your NetSuite app in Cobalt for OAuth, you will need the following credentials from your NetSuite account: Client ID Client Secret Account ID Scopes ​ Pre-requisites NetSuite account. OAuth Enabled in Netsuite. ​ Required Settings Mandatory Scopes rest_webservices suite_analytics If you haven’t already created an app in NetSuite, you’d need to create one. ​ Enable OAuth in NetSuite Before creating an app in NetSuite, you are required to enable OAuth. Follow the steps given below: Navigate to Setup > Company > Enable Features in your Netsuite account. Select the SuiteCloud tab present, scroll down and enable the following in your settings: SOAP Web Services (under SuiteTalk (Web Services) ) REST Web Services (under SuiteTalk (Web Services) ) SuiteSignon (under Manage Authentication ) OAuth 2.0 (under Manage Authentication ) ​ Creating an app in NetSuite To create a NetSuite app and aquire the above mentioned credentials, please follow the steps mentioned below: Log in to your Netsuite account with Admin permissions. To get your Account ID , navigate to Setup > Company > Company Information and copy the Account ID present there. Click on Setup > Integration > Manage Integrations and choose New . Enter the App Name and under Authentication > Token-based authentication , first uncheck the TBA: Authorization Flow and then Token based authentication . You are required to first uncheck the TBA: Authorization Flow checkbox as it cannot be disabled if the Token based authentication checkbox is disabled first. Go to your Apps catalog in Cobalt > Search for Netsuite > Settings > Use your credentials > Callback Url > Copy it. Paste the Callback Uri under Redirect URI field under OAuth 2.0 in the app. Select the mandatory scopes in the Scope section under OAuth 2.0 , as provided in your Cobalt Netsuite settings page and click on the Save button. Scroll down and copy the Client ID and Client Secret from the Client Credentials section. ​ Configuring credentials in Cobalt App settings page lets you configure the authentication settings for an OAuth 2.0 based application. For your customers to provide you authorization to access their data, they would first need to install your application. This page lets you set up your application credentials. Cobalt lets you use pre-configured applications to play around. You can do so by selecting Use our credentials . However, if you wish to use your own application, select Use your own credentials . Provide the aquired Client Id and Client secret and save it. ​ Configuring Scopes Cobalt lets you configure what permissions to ask from your users while they install your application. The scopes can be added or removed from the App settings page, under Permissions & Scopes section. For some applications Cobalt sets mandatory scopes which cannot be removed. Additional scopes can be selected from the drop down. Cobalt also has the provision to add any custom scopes supported by the respective platform. Once the scopes has been added to the application in Cobalt, go to your Netsuite account and update the scopes as added on Cobalt. Select the OAuth App created for Cobalt > Click on Edit > Add the scopes as added in Cobalt > Click on Save . If you are facing scopes missing or invalid scope error. Make sure you are not passing any custom scope not supported by the platform. And, the scopes selected here are identical to the ones selected in the platform. ​ Actions and triggers Once the above setup is completed, you can create orchestrations of your use-cases using NetSuite actions and triggers.

Users can specify the primary color , which represents the main color theme of the brand, and the button color , which determines the color of interactive elements. Color selection can be done by entering the hexadecimal code or choosing from a color palette . This customization empowers users to align the appearance of Linked Accounts with their brand identity, enhancing brand consistency and recognition. After selecting the colours and clicking on the Save button, the user can see the changes reflecting in the Linked Accounts. ​ Redirection The Redirection component enables users to configure three essential URLs that enhance the customer experience within Linked Accounts: ​ App Redirection Users can specify the URL where customers will be redirected upon completing the linking process. This redirection ensures a seamless transition for customers and enhances user engagement post-linking. ​ Privacy Policy URL Users can provide the URL to their privacy policy, which will be prominently displayed within Linked Accounts. This transparency helps build trust with customers by providing clear information on data handling and privacy practices. ​ Terms of Use URL Users can specify the URL to their terms of use, ensuring that customers have access to important legal information governing the use of Linked Accounts.

Navigation Hosting Solutions Azure Documentation Implementation & Guides API Reference SDKs Resources Cobalt home page v2 Postman Get Your API Key Examples Getting Started Introduction Quickstart Build Platform Setup Connectors Workflows Advanced Features Ship Integrations Auth Flows Try API Maintain Observability with Logs Reliability Custom App Custom App Setup Deployment Cobalt Deployment Hosting Solutions Cobalt Hosting Solutions AWS Deployment Azure GCP Deployment Governance & Compliance Security Application Security Compliance & Certifications Privacy Policy Term of Use Hosting Solutions Azure This guide helps you install and deploy Cobalt’s on-prem solution on your Kubernetes cluster in Azure. It covers the setup of essential dependencies, including Redis and MongoDB, and guides you through creating a Kubernetes cluster on Azure. After successfully setting up your cluster, you’ll configure your environment to pull images from our private Docker repository and install our services via Helm charts. ​ Prerequisites An Azure account Docker credentials (you will receive a Personal Access Token (PAT) from the Cobalt team) Redis (managed or self-hosted) MongoDB (managed or self-hosted, recommended: MongoDB Atlas) ​ 1. Setting Up Azure CLI on Your Local Machine To interact with Azure services and your AKS (Azure Kubernetes Service) cluster, you need to set up the Azure CLI on your local machine. ​ Step 1: Install Azure CLI Download and install the Azure CLI by following the instructions provided in the official Azure documentation : Install the Azure CLI. Verify the installation by running: az --version ​ Step 2: Sign in and Configure Azure CLI After installation, sign in to your Azure account: Run the command: az login Follow the prompts to authenticate. ​ 2. Redis Setup You can either use a managed Redis instance (via Azure Cache for Redis) or host Redis yourself. ​ Option 1: Managed Redis (Azure Cache for Redis) Navigate to the Azure Portal . Search for Azure Cache for Redis and create a new cache instance. Configure the following settings: DNS name : Choose a unique name for your Redis instance. Pricing tier : Select the appropriate tier based on your requirements. Eviction policy : Configure to noeviction to ensure Redis works properly with BullMQ. After creating the instance, note down the hostname and primary key for configuration. Ensure your AKS cluster has network access to the Redis instance. You may need to configure virtual network (VNet) integration and firewall rules . ​ Option 2: Self-Hosted Redis Installation Install Redis using Helm on your Kubernetes cluster: helm repo add bitnami https://charts.bitnami.com/bitnami helm install redis bitnami/redis --set redis.configuration = \"maxmemory-policy noeviction\" Verify Redis installation: kubectl exec -it $( kubectl get pods -l app.kubernetes.io/name = redis -o jsonpath = \"{.items[0].metadata.name}\" ) -- redis-cli ping ​ 3. MongoDB Setup You can either use a managed MongoDB instance with MongoDB Atlas or host MongoDB yourself. ​ Option 1: Managed MongoDB (MongoDB Atlas) Go to MongoDB Atlas and create an account or log in. Create a new cluster: Choose the appropriate region based on your workload and proximity to your Kubernetes cluster. Select the cluster tier (e.g., M10, M20, etc.) depending on your usage needs. Once the cluster is created, set up access: Add your Kubernetes cluster’s IP address (or CIDR) to the IP Whitelist to allow access. Create a database user with proper permissions (e.g., readWrite ). Get the connection string: Navigate to your cluster, click Connect , and copy the connection string. Use this connection string in your configuration files to connect your services to MongoDB. ​ Option 2: Self-Hosted MongoDB Installation Install MongoDB using Helm: helm repo add bitnami https://charts.bitnami.com/bitnami helm install mongodb bitnami/mongodb --set auth.rootPassword = < password > ,auth.username = < user > ,auth.password = < password > ,auth.database = < db_name > Verify MongoDB installation: kubectl exec -it $( kubectl get pods -l app.kubernetes.io/name = mongodb -o jsonpath = \"{.items[0].metadata.name}\" ) -- mongo --eval \"db.stats()\" ​ 4. Setting Up Kubernetes Cluster on Azure (AKS) ​ Step 1: Creating an AKS Cluster To set up a Kubernetes cluster on Azure, you can use Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) . Navigate to the Azure Portal . Search for Kubernetes services and click Create . Configure the following details: Resource group : Create a new one or select an existing one. Kubernetes cluster name : Name your cluster (e.g., cobalt-cluster ). Region : Select the appropriate region. Node size : Choose a node size (e.g., Standard_DS2_v2 ). Node count : Set the initial node count as needed. Click Review + create and then Create . ​ Step 2: Connect to Your AKS Cluster After your cluster is created, connect to it using the Azure CLI : Run the following command to configure kubectl : az aks get-credentials --resource-group < resource-group-name > --name cobalt-cluster ​ 5. Creating Docker Registry Credentials Once your Kubernetes cluster is ready, you’ll need to create a secret to pull Docker images from the private GitHub Container Registry (GHCR). You will receive a Personal Access Token (PAT) from the Cobalt team. Run the following command to create the secret: kubectl create secret docker-registry regcred \\ --docker-server = https://ghcr.io \\ --docker-username = < user-name > \\ --docker-password = < PAT > \\ --docker-email = < email > \\ -n services This command creates a secret named regcred in the services namespace that will allow Kubernetes to authenticate and pull images from the private repository. ​ 6. Applying ConfigMaps and Secrets Provided by Cobalt As part of the Cobalt setup, you’ll receive ConfigMaps and Secrets from our team. These files contain important configurations such as REDIS_HOST , MONGODB_URI , and other service-related settings. ​ Option 1: Manually Applying ConfigMaps and Secrets Update the YAML Files : Modify the received ConfigMap and Secret YAML files with your environment-specific values. For example, update REDIS_HOST , MONGODB_URI , and other configurations to match your setup. Apply the Files : Use the following commands to apply the ConfigMaps and Secrets to your Kubernetes cluster: kubectl apply -f < configmap.yaml > -n services kubectl apply -f < secret.yaml > -n services Replace and Repeat for All Files : Replace <configmap.yaml> and <secret.yaml> with the actual file names you received. Apply this process for each ConfigMap and Secret file provided by Cobalt. Notes: Ensure you are in the correct namespace ( services ) when applying these configurations. Double-check all values in the files to avoid misconfigurations. ​ Option 2: Using apply_all.sh Script Alternatively, you can use the provided apply_all.sh script to apply all ConfigMap and Secret files at once after updating the values. Update the YAML Files : Ensure you have updated all necessary values (e.g., REDIS_HOST , MONGODB_URI , etc.) in the provided YAML files. Run the Script : Execute the script using the following command: ./apply_all.sh The script will automatically apply all the updated YAML files (ConfigMaps and Secrets) to your Kubernetes cluster, simplifying the process. Notes: Verify that all YAML files are updated correctly before running the script. Ensure the script has the necessary execution permissions. If not, grant permissions using: chmod +x apply_all.sh ​ 7. Installing Cobalt Services via Helm After setting up Redis, MongoDB, the Kubernetes cluster, Docker registry credentials, ConfigMaps, and Secrets, you are ready to install the Cobalt services. ​ To Install Cobalt Services Use the provided install_all.sh script to install all necessary services: ./install_all.sh This script will handle the installation of all Cobalt services on your Kubernetes cluster, streamlining the deployment process. Notes: Ensure the script has the necessary execution permissions. If not, grant permissions using: chmod +x install_all.sh ​ To Uninstall Cobalt Services If you need to uninstall the services, use the provided uninstall_all.sh script: ./uninstall_all.sh This script will cleanly uninstall all Cobalt services from your cluster.

It provides users with visibility into the data generated by the instance during execution. ​ Configuring Data Input The Data input field allows users to specify the desired data from the response. Users can choose from a variety of options, including selecting DataSlots or choosing Nodes that have completed before the Response Node in the workflow. Once selected, users can further refine their choice to extract specific fields or data from the response. One of the key functionalities of the Response Node is its ability to simplify the extraction of specific data from the response generated by previous actions in the workflow.

In Cobalt, you can manage which users can access a workflow created by you. One of the primary tools for implementing access control is through User-Defined Function (UDF) parameters. UDF parameters empower users to filter configurations for Linked Accounts, thereby granting access to specific workflows only to authorized users or entities. Learn in detail about the UDF Parameter in our guide here . ​ Creating UDF Parameters In the Config Portal of a Workflow, users can set up Access conditions to control who can interact with the workflow. Please ensure that UDF Parameters on which the access will be controlled, have been created and set for the Linked Accounts. You can add UDF Parameters to the Linked Accounts either programmatically or by the UI of Cobalt. Using either the Upsert Linked Account API or .upsertLinkedAccount() method of the NodeJS SDK, you can add UDF parameter. Learn how to create UDF Parameter through the dashboard here . Param Required Type Description linked_account_id Mandatory String Unique customer identifier name Optional String Name of the customer UDF Optional Object User specific preliminary data your_app Optional Object Auth specific data The request upserts a Linked Account with the UDF Parameters as requested and gives the following Response Response { \"_id\" : \"65d5ba54d31e3880a27ebefd\" , \"associated_org\" : \"65c9ef72f4b95fce32e8ccf8\" , \"account_id\" : \"<Linked_account_id>\" , \"environment\" : \"test\" , \"name\" : \"John Doe\" , \"udf\" : [ { \"key_name\" : \"Role\" , \"key_value\" : \"Member\" , \"_id\" : \"660bd08b01d2ef85025d707c\" , \"updatedAt\" : \"2024-04-02T09:31:55.647Z\" , \"createdAt\" : \"2024-04-02T09:31:55.647Z\" } , { \"key_name\" : \"Title\" , \"key_value\" : \"Sr. Developer\" , \"_id\" : \"660bd08b01d2ef85025d707d\" , \"updatedAt\" : \"2024-04-02T09:31:55.647Z\" , \"createdAt\" : \"2024-04-02T09:31:55.647Z\" } ] , \"createdAt\" : \"2024-02-21T08:54:44.607Z\" , \"updatedAt\" : \"2024-04-02T09:31:55.647Z\" , \"__v\" : 34 } ​ Configuring Access Controls To configure the Access Controls, go to the Workflow in Cobalt for which you want to do so. Click on the Config Portal button in the top right of the workflow. Here you have the option to define Access conditions such as Match all conditions or Match any condition . Users can then specify the name of the UDF parameter and its corresponding value that should be allowed to access the Workflow. This workflow will now be visible only to the Linked Accounts which satsify the Access Control conditions.

Some examples of dataslots are: Slack - Select a channel where messages will be posted Greenhouse/Lever - Select a job where candidates will be added Hubspot/Pipedrive - Select a stage to which the deal has to be added Docusign - Select a template from which a document will be sent to a signer ​ Create config dataslots on Cobalt’s platform The first thing is to add a new config dataslot inside each application by clicking on Config Portal . There are different types of config dataslots such as Select, Mapping, JSON, text and more. Look at the below example to set a new config dataslot. ​ Handling multiple configs Handling multiple configs is an advanced feature for users who want to store and run different configs for a single workflow. To do so, we need to set a unique id while calling the config() and updateConfig() functions. ​ Step 1: Setting a unique config id You can set a unique config while calling the .config() function as shown below. Make sure that config ids are stored on your end. cobalt . config ( 'pipedrive' , 'configid-1' ) ; //creating a config using an id 'configid-1' cobalt . config ( 'pipedrive' , 'configid-2' ) ; //creating a config using another id 'configid-2' Similarly, while calling the updateConfig() function make sure that you also use the respective config id. ​ Step 2: Using Config id while triggering events While triggering a new event from the backend SDK, you need to pass the respective config id to use the stored value inside the config. // Send the \"New Contact Created\" App Event try { const data = await Client . event ( { linked_account_id : \"<Account Id of the user eg: example@someemail.com>\" , event : \"New Contact Created\" , config_id : \"configid-2\" , //event will trigger a workflow using configid-2 payload : { \"name\" : \"Jeff Atwood\" , \"email\" : \"jeff@stackoverflow.com\" , \"phone\" : \"4151231234\" , \"company\" : \"Stack Overflow\" , \"role\" : \"Founder\" } } ) } catch ( error ) { //Catch any error } Overview What are Field Types linkedin twitter Powered by Mintlify On this page Create config dataslots on Cobalt’s platform Handling multiple configs Step 1: Setting a unique config id Step 2: Using Config id while triggering events"

Navigation Hosting Solutions GCP Deployment Documentation Implementation & Guides API Reference SDKs Resources Cobalt home page v2 Postman Get Your API Key Examples Getting Started Introduction Quickstart Build Platform Setup Connectors Workflows Advanced Features Ship Integrations Auth Flows Try API Maintain Observability with Logs Reliability Custom App Custom App Setup Deployment Cobalt Deployment Hosting Solutions Cobalt Hosting Solutions AWS Deployment Azure GCP Deployment Governance & Compliance Security Application Security Compliance & Certifications Privacy Policy Term of Use Hosting Solutions GCP Deployment This guide helps you install and deploy Cobalt’s on-prem solution on your Kubernetes cluster. It covers the setup of essential dependencies, including Redis and MongoDB, and guides you through creating a Kubernetes cluster on GCP. After successfully setting up your cluster, you’ll configure your environment to pull images from our private Docker repository and install our services via Helm charts. ​ Prerequisites A Kubernetes cluster (GCP setup instructions provided below) Docker credentials (you will receive a Personal Access Token (PAT) from the Cobalt team) Redis (managed or self-hosted) MongoDB (managed or self-hosted, recommended: MongoDB Atlas) ​ 1. Redis Setup You can either use a managed Redis instance or host Redis yourself. ​ Option 1: Managed Redis (Google Cloud MemoryStore) Go to the Google Cloud Console. Navigate to MemoryStore > Redis > Create Instance . Choose the following settings: Instance ID : Choose a unique ID. Region : Select the same region as your Kubernetes cluster. Tier : Select a tier depending on your requirements (Standard or Basic). Eviction Policy : Set to no-eviction to ensure Redis works properly with BullMQ. Once the instance is created, note down the connection endpoint. You will use this endpoint in your environment configuration to connect Cobalt services to Redis. Ensure your Kubernetes pods can access this Redis instance by setting up appropriate firewall rules in your GCP project. ​ Option 2: Self-Hosted Redis Installation Install Redis using Helm on your Kubernetes cluster: helm repo add bitnami https://charts.bitnami.com/bitnami helm install redis bitnami/redis --set redis.configuration = \"maxmemory-policy noeviction\" Verify Redis installation: kubectl exec -it $( kubectl get pods -l app.kubernetes.io/name = redis -o jsonpath = \"{.items[0].metadata.name}\" ) -- redis-cli ping ​ 2. MongoDB Setup You can either use a managed MongoDB instance with MongoDB Atlas or host MongoDB yourself. ​ Option 1: Managed MongoDB (MongoDB Atlas) Go to MongoDB Atlas and create an account or log in. Create a new cluster: Choose the appropriate region based on your workload and proximity to your Kubernetes cluster. Select the cluster tier (e.g., M10, M20, etc.) depending on your usage needs. Once the cluster is created, set up access: Add your Kubernetes cluster’s IP address (or CIDR) to the IP Whitelist to allow access. Create a database user with proper permissions (e.g., readWrite ). Get the connection string: Navigate to your cluster, click Connect , and copy the connection string. Use this connection string in your configuration files to connect your services to MongoDB. ​ Option 2: Self-Hosted MongoDB Installation Install MongoDB using Helm: helm repo add bitnami https://charts.bitnami.com/bitnami helm install mongodb bitnami/mongodb --set auth.rootPassword = < password > ,auth.username = < user > ,auth.password = < password > ,auth.database = < db_name > Verify MongoDB installation: kubectl exec -it $( kubectl get pods -l app.kubernetes.io/name = mongodb -o jsonpath = \"{.items[0].metadata.name}\" ) -- mongo --eval \"db.stats()\" ​ 3. Setting Up Kubernetes Cluster on GCP You can either create an autopilot or a standard cluster on GCP. Here’s how: ​ Autopilot Cluster Setup Create the cluster using the following command: gcloud container clusters create-auto cobalt-cluster --region < region > Get credentials for the cluster: gcloud container clusters get-credentials cobalt-cluster --region < region > ​ Standard Cluster Setup Create the cluster: gcloud container clusters create cobalt-cluster --region < region > --machine-type = e2-standard-4 Get credentials for the cluster: gcloud container clusters get-credentials cobalt-cluster --region < region > Create a namespace for the services: kubectl create namespace services ​ 4. Creating Docker Registry Credentials Once your Kubernetes cluster is ready, you’ll need to create a secret to pull Docker images from the private GitHub Container Registry (GHCR). You will receive a Personal Access Token (PAT) from the Cobalt team. Run the following command to create the secret: kubectl create secret docker-registry regcred \\ --docker-server = https://ghcr.io \\ --docker-username = < user-name > \\ --docker-password = < PAT > \\ --docker-email = < email > \\ -n services This command creates a secret named regcred in the services namespace that will allow Kubernetes to authenticate and pull images from the private repository. ​ 5. Applying ConfigMaps and Secrets Provided by Cobalt As part of the Cobalt setup, you’ll receive ConfigMaps and Secrets from our team. These files contain important configurations such as REDIS_HOST , MONGODB_URI , and other service-related settings. ​ Option 1: Manually Applying ConfigMaps and Secrets Update ConfigMap and Secret YAML Files Modify the YAML files (e.g., configmap.yaml and secret.yaml ) to include environment-specific values. For example: REDIS_HOST , MONGODB_URI , and any other service-related settings should match your environment. Apply ConfigMap and Secret Files Use the following kubectl commands to apply the ConfigMap and Secret to the services namespace in your Kubernetes cluster: kubectl apply -f < configmap.yaml > -n services kubectl apply -f < secret.yaml > -n services Replace <configmap.yaml> and <secret.yaml> with the actual names of the YAML files you received. Repeat the process for all ConfigMap and Secret files provided. ​ Option 2: Using apply_all.sh Script You can use the provided apply_all.sh script to apply all ConfigMap and Secret files at once after updating the necessary values (e.g., REDIS_HOST , MONGODB_URI , etc.) in the YAML files. Ensure all required values are updated in the YAML files. Run the script: ./apply_all.sh This should display properly when rendered in a compatible MDX environment. Let me know if you need any further modifications! ​ 6. Installing Cobalt Services via Helm After setting up Redis, MongoDB, the Kubernetes cluster, Docker registry credentials, ConfigMaps, and Secrets, you are ready to install the Cobalt services. ​ To Install Cobalt Services Use the provided install_all.sh script to install all necessary services: ./install_all.sh This script will handle the installation of all Cobalt services on your Kubernetes cluster. ​ To Uninstall Cobalt Services If you need to uninstall the services, use the provided uninstall_all.sh script: ./uninstall_all.sh This script will cleanly uninstall all Cobalt services from your cluster. This guide provides the foundational setup for deploying Cobalt services, including the option to use the apply_all.sh script for easier management of ConfigMaps and Secrets.

It allows you to: Execute multiple test cases for a workflow by modifying the input payload. Test and inspect the output values of each workflow node. Use the Run Node button at the bottom of each step to execute it for the authenticated Linked Account. ​ Pre-requisites for Workflow Testing Before testing a workflow, ensure the following steps are completed: Configure a Linked Account Click the Configuration button in the workflow editor and select a Linked Account under Prerequisites for the workflow. If the Linked Account is not authenticated with the integration or if its authentication has expired, a warning will appear. Click the Authorize Application button to reauthenticate or establish a connection with the integration. Once authentication is complete, a Connected status will be displayed. Click Next to proceed. Provide a Sample Payload Enter a payload with data to be used during workflow testing. A sample payload will automatically load based on the event trigger defined in the workflow. Modify the sample payload if necessary to suit your testing requirements. After completing these steps, click the Save Configuration button. Your workflow is now ready for testing. ​ Steps to test Cobalt provides options for testing both ndividual nodes or the entire workflow. ​ Testing Node 1 Select Node Click on the node you want to test. 2 Run Node In the node, switch to Input/Output tab and click on Run Node button. Testing for Group Node and Pagination is currently not supported. Once the node executes successfully, a checkmark appears on the node, indicating it has been tested. ​ Testing Entire Workflow Open the testing modal present at the bottom. Click on Run Workflow button to perform a test execution and a Test Run log is generated with output of each node. Since testing for Group nodes is not supported currently, you might not receive the logs of the group node. ​ Workflow Templating In Cobalt workflows, you can use dynamic variables generated through Run Node test execution to seamlessly access data from previous nodes. This method allows you to incorporate tested node response data into subsequent nodes. To learn more about how to do Templating in Cobalt, refer to the docs here . Simply go to input field where you want to use variable within a node, select Nodes tab from the Insert Variable modal, choose the node whose response you want to access and select the field from that node response. In this example, we used the id received in the response when project was created and it’s visible as 4.id in the field which is of the format <node_number>.<response_field> . This streamlined approach of Workflow Testing ensures that your workflows perform as expected before deploying them in production.

After selecting the colours and clicking on the Save button, the user can see the changes reflecting in the Linked Accounts. ​ Redirection The Redirection component enables users to configure three essential URLs that enhance the customer experience within Linked Accounts: ​ App Redirection Users can specify the URL where customers will be redirected upon completing the linking process. This redirection ensures a seamless transition for customers and enhances user engagement post-linking. ​ Privacy Policy URL Users can provide the URL to their privacy policy, which will be prominently displayed within Linked Accounts. This transparency helps build trust with customers by providing clear information on data handling and privacy practices. ​ Terms of Use URL Users can specify the URL to their terms of use, ensuring that customers have access to important legal information governing the use of Linked Accounts. This enhances transparency and compliance while fostering trust and confidence among users. By leveraging the Brand section, users can effectively tailor the visual representation and user experience of their brand within Linked Accounts, strengthening brand identity and customer engagement.

This is particularly useful when there are parallel processes within a workflow that need to converge at a common point before proceeding with the subsequent actions. ​ Use Case for Merge Consider a scenario where two parallel processes need to run simultaneously, and once both processes are completed, a common action or set of actions should be executed. So rather than replicating the same flow for each branch, leading to increased complexity and a higher number of nodes, the Merge Node allows these branches to converge seamlessly. The Merge will not be successful if any of the nodes which are being merged through the Merge Node are failing. ​ Example Scenario Parallel Processing : You have three branches/nodes running different processes in parallel. Convergence : Once all three branches complete their respective tasks, they need to converge to perform a common action, such as creating a datastore or any other action. By using the Merge Node, you can bring both branches together, eliminating the need to duplicate the subsequent steps for each branch.

Workflow failures can occur due to various reasons, ranging from configuration errors to external dependencies. Before investigating possible reasons for workflow failure, users must ensure the following prerequisites are met for the workflow to execute successfully: Published Workflow : The workflow must be published to be executed. Enabled Status : The workflow should be enabled either automatically or manually by the end-users. Access Control : Ensure that the workflow is accessible to the end-users through proper access control configurations. Triggering Event : The correct event must be triggered for the workflow to execute. ​ Handling Workflow Failures When a workflow fails to execute, users can follow these steps to diagnose and address the issue: ​ Check Execution Logs Navigate to the Logs section in the Cobalt dashboard and review the Execution logs for the workflow. Look for error messages or exceptions that might indicate the cause of the failure. You can also Retry and rerun either the entire workflow or the errored node if you think if you have solved the error. Retry can be performed only one time each for the workflow and the node. Retry Nodes : If the failure is isolated to a specific node within the workflow, users can retry that particular node to attempt execution again. This can be done directly from the execution logs interface. Retry Entire Workflow: In cases where retrying individual nodes does not resolve the issue, users have the option to retry the entire workflow execution. ​ Subscribe to Cobalt Webhooks Users can subscribe to Cobalt Webhooks to receive real-time notifications about errored workflows. This will allow users to proactively address issues as they occur. To learn more about the Cobalt Webhooks, you can refer to our guide here . Cobalt Webhook Subscription can be done either through the dashboard or the Subscribe to Events API. Subscription via Dashboard : Navigate to the Webhooks section in the Cobalt dashboard, enter the Webhook URL , choose the Webhook Payload as either Default or Slack and select the Workflow Errored event for which the notifications will be sent. Subscription via API : Users can subscribe to Cobalt Webhooks using the Subscribe to Events API. Request - Make a POST request to the /webhook/subscribe endpoint with the webhook event as workflow-errored . cURL curl -- request POST \\ -- url https : / / api . gocobalt . io / api / v2 / public / webhook / subscribe \\ -- header 'Content-Type: application/json' \\ -- header 'x-api-key: <api-key>' \\ -- data ' { \"webhook_events\" : [ \"workflow-errored\" ] } ' Response - The request will respond with a JSON object containing the Webhook URL and the Event which was subscribed. 200 { \"webhook_url\" : \"https://mysite.com/cobalt/webhook\" , \"webhook_events\" : [ \"workflow-errored\" ] } You will now receive a notification on your registered URL whenever a Workflow errors.

Cobalt offers both Key Based and OAuth 2.0 integration for Salesloft. In this guide, we will look at the OAuth App setup process. To setup your Salesloft app in Cobalt for OAuth, you will need the following credentials from your Salesloft Developer account : Client ID Client Secret Scopes ​ Pre-requisites Salesloft Developer account. ​ Required Settings Mandatory Scopes Accounts: Manage Accounts: Read If you haven’t already created an app in Salesloft, you’d need to create one. ​ Creating an app in Salesloft To create a Salesloft app and aquire the above mentioned credentials, please follow the steps mentioned below: Log in to your Salesloft Developer account . Click on the Manage Apps button in the top nav bar. Click on Create New button in OAuth Applications . Go to your Apps catalog in Cobalt > Search for Salesloft > Settings > Use your credentials > Callback Url > Copy it. Give the app Name > Paste the Callback Url copied under Redirect URL field > Select Application Type as Public application > Select the required Scopes and click on Save . Appl type is selected as Public Application to ensure people outside your organization can authenticate with it as well. Copy the Application ID (Client ID) and Secret (Client Secret) displayed on the screen. ​ Configuring credentials in Cobalt App settings page lets you configure the authentication settings for an OAuth 2.0 based application. For your customers to provide you authorization to access their data, they would first need to install your application. This page lets you set up your application credentials. Cobalt lets you use pre-configured applications to play around. You can do so by selecting Use our credentials . However, if you wish to use your own application, select Use your own credentials . Provide the aquired Client Id and Client secret and save it. ​ Configuring Scopes Cobalt lets you configure what permissions to ask from your users while they install your application. The scopes can be added or removed from the App settings page, under Permissions & Scopes section. For some applications Cobalt sets mandatory scopes which cannot be removed. Additional scopes can be selected from the drop down. Cobalt also has the provision to add any custom scopes supported by the respective platform. Once the scopes has been added to the application in Cobalt, go to your Salesloft Developer account and update the scopes as added on Cobalt. Select the OAuth App created for Cobalt and click on Edit for it > Add the scopes under Scopes as added in Cobalt > Click on Submit . If you are facing scopes missing or invalid scope error. Make sure you are not passing any custom scope not supported by the platform. And, the scopes selected here are identical to the ones selected in the platform. ​ Getting Production Credentials of App Once you’ve built your app using OAuth Authenication, you must submit it to be reviewed for allowlisting so that it can be used by other Salesloft instances. To more about the Salesloft App Publishing process, refer here . ​ Actions and triggers Once the above setup is completed, you can create orchestrations of your use-cases using Salesloft actions and triggers. Following are the set of Salesloft actions and triggers supported by Cobalt. Actions Triggers Accounts Create Account - Create a new account in Salesloft. List Accounts - Get a list of accounts in Salesloft. Update Account - Update an account in Salesloft. Delete Account - Delete an account in Salesloft.

Know more about Linked Accounts and how you can create one in the guide here . We recommend you create a linked account at the same time as your customer signs up within your app. 2. Generate Session Token Generate a Session Token for your Linked Account. The session token gets expired in 24 hours. Please make sure you generate a new token in every new session or within 24 hours. ​ Auth flow integration options Cobalt provides 3 different ways for Auth flow of integrations ​ Hosted Flow Hosted flow Redirects user to Cobalt Connect hosted on `https://connect.gocobalt.io`. Hosted flow is a no-code solution, so you don’t need to build your own UI to handle the integration authentication. It handles the following features: List all enabled applications Handle the Auth flow Manage integration configuration for your end user. Dynamic field mapping feature is currently not supported in the Hosted auth flow. To get started, follow the 2 steps: 1 Generate Hosted URL To use Hosted flow, you will need to first get the hosted URL. This can be achieved by making a POST request to the Create Hosted URL API. Check out the Cobalt’s API Reference for more details. 2 Redirect to Hosted portal The generated URL can be then used to redirect the user to the Hosted UI, or can be embedded within your UI. Your user can select the application they want to connect and perform authentication. You can modify the UI of Hosted Portal using the hosted_properties . Property Description color Modify the theme color of Cobalt connect name Display name of your end customer bgColor Background Colour of your end customer ​ Embedded Flow (Cobalt Modals) Embedded Flow Utilize the React SDK and embed it seamlessly within your React application. Cobalt Embedded flow is a frontend SDK that allows you to embed Cobalt auth flow into your React application. It’s a simple process involving steps like Generate Session Token > Install and Initialise Frontend SDK and Render the Component . Learn more about Cobalt’s React SDK and how to initialize it here . For example implementation, you can check out the App.js file in the example directory. ​ Seamless Flow (Build your own Frontend) Seamless Flow Utilize our REST APIs and NodeJs SDK methods to implement and customize the authentication experience. Cobalt provides APIs and SDK functions that allow your customers to connect your platform with the third party applications. The general steps to build your own flow are: Display a list of integrations for your users to select Retrieve a list of all integrations available to connect using the List Applications API or .getApplications() method and display them in your UI. With the above call you can get all the details related to an appliction for a user. We recommend using the assets provided by Cobalt as they meet the requirements of the supported integrations. For example QuickBooks Online require the specific use of QuickBooks branded buttons, including specific hover states. Install and Initialise SDK Install the Cobalt Frontend SDK for JavaScript that you want to use. You can install by either using npm package manager or directly in browser by using the script tag. <!-- use a specific version --> < script src = \" https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@cobaltio/cobalt-js@3.0.1 \" > </ script > <!-- use a version range instead of a specific version --> < script src = \" https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@cobaltio/cobalt-js@3 \" > </ script > < script src = \" https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@cobaltio/cobalt-js@3.0 \" > </ script > <!-- omit the version completely to use the latest one --> <!-- you should NOT use this in production --> < script src = \" https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@cobaltio/cobalt-js \" > </ script > Initialize the javascript SDK using the Session token. Learn more about Cobalt’s JS SDK and how to initialize it here . Manage Connections Cobalt provides the flexibility for you to manage your customers’ application connections. The .connect() method lets your customers to connect to an application platform, authorizing you to access the platform APIs and data on their behalf. cobalt . connect ( \"slack\" ) // opens a new tab for oauth apps cobalt . connect ( \"twilio\" , { number : < \"Registered number\" > , sid : \"ACCOUNT_SID\" , } ) // saves the auth data for key based apps The .disconnect() method similarly, lets the user to disconnect from the application platform, revoking the authorization and deleting any and all configurations of the Linked account saved for that particular application. cobalt . disconnect ( \"slack\" ) Allow users to configure the connection Once the user has successfully authenticated in their platform, he is redirected back to your app integration page. Use the .config() method to find an exisiting config or creating a new config for the linked account. cobalt . config ( { slug : \"slack\" , config_id : \"OPTIONAL_ID_FOR_THIS_CONFIG\" , labels : { } , // optional dynamic labels } ) Save/Update the configuration The .config() method provides you with all the published workflows and settings input for the user. The user can now enable the workflows, enter data for the settings and map fields. These updates to the config can be made using the .updateConfig() method. cobalt . updateConfig ( { slug : \"slack\" , config_id : \"OPTIONAL_ID_FOR_THIS_CONFIG\" , fields : { \"64da0b57c9ae95561bb0a24d\" : \"C044U7Q074J\" } , workflows : [ { id : \"64d1fac58716dc5065127ffe\" , enabled : true , fields : { \"64da0b57c9ae95561bb0a24f\" : \"C044U7Q074J\" } } ] } ) ​ Authorization journey Cobalt lets you take the authorization for customer’s data in 3 simple steps: Open the auth flow portal for the customer using any of the above mentioned integration options. Customer provides consent or API Credentials for the respective app. Customer configures the data required for the connection, such as selecting specific integration settings. And done! Customer has now successfully connected the application(s) and can now make use of the published orchestrations.

Workflow failures can occur due to various reasons, ranging from configuration errors to external dependencies. Before investigating possible reasons for workflow failure, users must ensure the following prerequisites are met for the workflow to execute successfully: Published Workflow : The workflow must be published to be executed. Enabled Status : The workflow should be enabled either automatically or manually by the end-users. Access Control : Ensure that the workflow is accessible to the end-users through proper access control configurations. Triggering Event : The correct event must be triggered for the workflow to execute. ​ Handling Workflow Failures When a workflow fails to execute, users can follow these steps to diagnose and address the issue: ​ Check Execution Logs Navigate to the Logs section in the Cobalt dashboard and review the Execution logs for the workflow. Look for error messages or exceptions that might indicate the cause of the failure. You can also Retry and rerun either the entire workflow or the errored node if you think if you have solved the error. Retry can be performed only one time each for the workflow and the node. Retry Nodes : If the failure is isolated to a specific node within the workflow, users can retry that particular node to attempt execution again. This can be done directly from the execution logs interface. Retry Entire Workflow: In cases where retrying individual nodes does not resolve the issue, users have the option to retry the entire workflow execution. ​ Subscribe to Cobalt Webhooks Users can subscribe to Cobalt Webhooks to receive real-time notifications about errored workflows. This will allow users to proactively address issues as they occur. To learn more about the Cobalt Webhooks, you can refer to our guide here . Cobalt Webhook Subscription can be done either through the dashboard or the Create Webhook API. Subscription via Dashboard : Navigate to the Webhooks section in the Cobalt dashboard, enter the Webhook URL , choose the Webhook Payload as either Default or Slack and select the Workflow Errored event for which the notifications will be sent. Subscription via API : Users can subscribe to Cobalt Webhooks using the Create Webhook API. Request - Make a POST request to the /webhook/subscribe endpoint with the webhook event as workflow-errored . cURL curl -- request POST \\ -- url https : / / api . gocobalt . io / api / v2 / public / webhook \\ -- header 'Content-Type: application/json' \\ -- header 'x-api-key: <api-key>' \\ -- data ' { \"webhook_url\" : \"<string>\" , \"webhook_events\" : [ \"<string>\" ] , \"is_enabled\" : true , \"webhook_type\" : \"<string>\" } ' Response - The request will respond with a JSON object containing the Webhook URL and the Event which was subscribed. 200 { \"is_enabled\" : false , \"webhook_events\" : [ \"Connection Created\" , \"Connection Deleted\" , \"Workflow Completed\" , \"Workflow Errored\" , \"Connection Expired\" ] , \"webhook_url\" : \"https://webhookurl.com\" , \"_id\" : \"66e31564c0287b4136f77ef8\" , \"createdAt\" : \"2024-09-12T16:23:00.587Z\" , \"webhook_type\" : \"slack\" } You will now receive a notification on your registered URL whenever a Workflow errors.

Parameter Group : Set the eviction policy to noeviction to ensure Redis works properly with BullMQ. After creating the instance, you’ll receive the primary endpoint . Use this endpoint to configure Redis in your Kubernetes deployment. Ensure your Kubernetes cluster has network access to the Redis instance: Configure VPC and security groups to allow access to the Redis instance. ​ Option 2: Self-Hosted Redis Installation Install Redis using Helm on your Kubernetes cluster: helm repo add bitnami https://charts.bitnami.com/bitnami helm install redis bitnami/redis --set redis.configuration = \"maxmemory-policy noeviction\" Verify Redis installation: kubectl exec -it $( kubectl get pods -l app.kubernetes.io/name = redis -o jsonpath = \"{.items[0].metadata.name}\" ) -- redis-cli ping ​ 3. MongoDB Setup You can either use a managed MongoDB instance with MongoDB Atlas or host MongoDB yourself. ​ Option 1: Managed MongoDB (MongoDB Atlas) Go to MongoDB Atlas and create an account or log in. Create a new cluster: Choose the appropriate region based on your workload and proximity to your Kubernetes cluster. Select the cluster tier (e.g., M10, M20, etc.) depending on your usage needs. Once the cluster is created, set up access: Add your Kubernetes cluster’s IP address (or CIDR) to the IP Whitelist to allow access. Create a database user with proper permissions (e.g., readWrite ). Get the connection string: Navigate to your cluster, click Connect , and copy the connection string. Use this connection string in your configuration files to connect your services to MongoDB. ​ Option 2: Self-Hosted MongoDB Installation Install MongoDB using Helm: helm repo add bitnami https://charts.bitnami.com/bitnami helm install mongodb bitnami/mongodb --set auth.rootPassword = < password > ,auth.username = < user > ,auth.password = < password > ,auth.database = < db_name > Verify MongoDB installation: kubectl exec -it $( kubectl get pods -l app.kubernetes.io/name = mongodb -o jsonpath = \"{.items[0].metadata.name}\" ) -- mongo --eval \"db.stats()\" ​ 4. Setting Up Kubernetes Cluster on AWS (EKS) ​ Step 1: Creating an EKS Cluster To set up a Kubernetes cluster on AWS, you can use Amazon EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service). Navigate to the AWS EKS Console . Click Create cluster and fill out the following details: Cluster name : Name your cluster (e.g., cobalt-cluster ). Cluster version : Select the latest Kubernetes version. Role ARN : Choose the IAM role that EKS will use to manage your cluster. Networking : Select the appropriate VPC, subnets, and security groups. Ensure these allow access to your database and Redis services. Wait for the cluster to be created. Connect to the cluster using kubectl by running the following command: aws eks --region < region > update-kubeconfig --name cobalt-cluster ​ Step 2: Creating Worker Nodes After your EKS cluster is created, you need to add worker nodes: Go to the EKS Node Groups section and click Add node group . Configure the node group with the following details: Node group name : Name the node group (e.g., cobalt-nodes ). Instance type : Choose an instance type (e.g., t3.medium ). Scaling configuration : Set the minimum and maximum number of nodes. Click Create to provision the worker nodes. ​ 5. Creating Docker Registry Credentials Once your Kubernetes cluster is ready, you’ll need to create a secret to pull Docker images from the private GitHub Container Registry (GHCR). You will receive a Personal Access Token (PAT) from the Cobalt team. Run the following command to create the secret: kubectl create secret docker-registry regcred \\ --docker-server = https://ghcr.io \\ --docker-username = < user-name > \\ --docker-password = < PAT > \\ --docker-email = < email > \\ -n services This command creates a secret named regcred in the services namespace that will allow Kubernetes to authenticate and pull images from the private repository. ​ 6. Applying ConfigMaps and Secrets Provided by Cobalt As part of the Cobalt setup, you’ll receive ConfigMaps and Secrets from our team. These files contain important configurations such as REDIS_HOST , MONGODB_URI , and other service-related settings. ​ Option 1: Manually Applying ConfigMaps and Secrets Update the YAML Files : Modify the received ConfigMap and Secret YAML files with your environment-specific values. For example, update REDIS_HOST , MONGODB_URI , and other configurations to match your setup. Apply the Files : Use the following commands to apply the ConfigMaps and Secrets to your Kubernetes cluster: kubectl apply -f < configmap.yaml > -n services kubectl apply -f < secret.yaml > -n services Replace and Repeat for All Files : Replace <configmap.yaml> and <secret.yaml> with the actual file names you received. Apply this process for each ConfigMap and Secret file provided by Cobalt. Notes: Ensure you are in the correct namespace ( services ) when applying these configurations. Double-check all values in the files to avoid misconfigurations. ​ Option 2: Using apply_all.sh Script Alternatively, you can use the provided apply_all.sh script to apply all ConfigMap and Secret files at once after updating the values. Update the YAML Files : Ensure you have updated all necessary values (e.g., REDIS_HOST , MONGODB_URI , etc.) in the provided YAML files. Run the Script : Execute the script using the following command: ./apply_all.sh The script will automatically apply all the updated YAML files (ConfigMaps and Secrets) to your Kubernetes cluster, simplifying the process. Notes: Verify that all YAML files are updated correctly before running the script. Ensure the script has the necessary execution permissions. If not, grant permissions using: chmod +x apply_all.sh ​ 7. Installing Cobalt Services via Helm After setting up Redis, MongoDB, the Kubernetes cluster, Docker registry credentials, ConfigMaps, and Secrets, you are ready to install the Cobalt services. ​ To Install Cobalt Services Use the provided install_all.sh script to install all necessary services: ./install_all.sh This script will handle the installation of all Cobalt services on your Kubernetes cluster, streamlining the deployment process. Notes: Ensure the script has the necessary execution permissions. If not, grant permissions using: chmod +x install_all.sh ​ To Uninstall Cobalt Services If you need to uninstall the services, use the provided uninstall_all.sh script: ./uninstall_all.sh This script will cleanly uninstall all Cobalt services from your cluster.

In certain scenarios where automatic re-authentication is not feasible, users may need to manually handle re-authentication. This process becomes necessary when either the refresh tokens expire, OAuth apps are deleted, integrations are disconnected, or access tokens are manually expired by the user. To facilitate this, you can identify the need for re-authentication and guide your users through the reconnection process effectively. ​ Determining the Need for Re-Authentication To determine if re-authentication is required, you can either use the List Applications API or .getApp() SDK method and check the reauth_required field in the response. By default, the field is false but if it returns true, then it indicates that re-authentication is necessary.

You take inputs from your end customers to facilitate your desired orchestration. To do so, Cobalt supports various types of fields to define the settings. ​ Primitive field types Primitive field types are the basic input types defined by Cobalt. Text , Number , Select , Email & Date fields can be used by the users to take inputs with the respective types from the user. Using the Select field type, you can let you customers select from a list of options defined by you. The end customer can select a value from your defined options, which can then be used in a workflow orchestration. ​ Select field types There might arise conditions where you want your end customers to select from a list which is platform specific and cannot be configured using Primitive field types. For example, List of Stages or List of Tags . Such lists are platform specific and prone to changes. As a result hard coding the options using Primitive field types is not recommended. To cater to such issues, Cobalt provides Select Fields . To use Select fields, create a setting and select the type from the list of Select fields available. The users can then select from the options defined for the field which is fetched from the platform in real time. The below image shows the list of Pipedrive Select fields to choose from. ​ Mapping fields type If you want your users to map a platform defined list of properties to the triggers payload properties being sent by you, then you should select Map V2 type. For example, Mapping Contact fields. You can define labels and ask the users to map the labels with the required custom properties defined in the platform. Learn more about Mapping here .

Let’s look at the example of Google Sheets, where value is not set for any of the three dataslots: /* The options appear only in the first config id because its value is not yet set and other config dataslots are dependent on this . * / { \"application_data_slots\" : [ { \"required\" : false , \"id\" : \"646333dbc7f3ab6e2bf4ed12\" , \"name\" : \"Select a Sheet\" , \"has_dynamic_map_fields\" : false , \"field_type\" : \"select\" , \"options\" : [ { \"name\" : \"List of users\" , \"value\" : \"11Sei6p5yHQmjyfHXeSXxpnIJRSSyM774X82-mOTJNe4\" } , { \"name\" : \"List of Employees\" , \"value\" : \"1eQWXziv-RbBye9OuyoQbGzZ3wHMcNedZ3x759O2EeZo\" } , { \"name\" : \"List of Contacts\" , \"value\" : \"1QVYAqowEnOgwxDzJ_AeODbmkdVAcL2ZW6LlRTZoMxVo\" } ] , \"dynamic_slot_identifier\" : \"dynamic:google_sheets:1\" , \"labels\" : [ ] } , { \"required\" : false , \"id\" : \"646333e5c7f3ab6e2bf4ed22\" , \"name\" : \"Select a Worksheet\" , \"has_dynamic_map_fields\" : false , \"field_type\" : \"select\" , \"parent\" : \"646333dbc7f3ab6e2bf4ed12\" , \"dynamic_slot_identifier\" : \"dynamic:google_sheets:2\" , \"labels\" : [ ] } , { \"required\" : false , \"id\" : \"646333f4c7f3ab6e2bf4ed4e\" , \"name\" : \"Select Headers\" , \"has_dynamic_map_fields\" : false , \"field_type\" : \"map\" , \"parent\" : \"646333e5c7f3ab6e2bf4ed22\" , \"dynamic_slot_identifier\" : \"dynamic:google_sheets:3\" , \"labels\" : [ { \"name\" : \"Header 1\" , \"value\" : \"6463340bc7f3ab6e2bf4edca\" } , { \"name\" : \"Header 2\" , \"value\" : \"6463340bc7f3ab6e2bf4edcb\" } , { \"name\" : \"Header 3\" , \"value\" : \"6463340bc7f3ab6e2bf4edcc\" } ] } ] , \"workflows\" : [ ] , \"config_id\" : \"1234\" } Once the values of Sheet and Worksheet config dataslots are set, all the options will come in the response: { \"application_data_slots\" : [ { \"required\" : false , \"id\" : \"646333dbc7f3ab6e2bf4ed12\" , \"name\" : \"Select a Sheet\" , \"has_dynamic_map_fields\" : false , \"field_type\" : \"select\" , \"options\" : [ { \"name\" : \"List of users\" , \"value\" : \"11Sei6p5yHQmjyfHXeSXxpnIJRSSyM774X82-mOTJNe4\" } , { \"name\" : \"List of Employees\" , \"value\" : \"1eQWXziv-RbBye9OuyoQbGzZ3wHMcNedZ3x759O2EeZo\" } , { \"name\" : \"List of Contacts\" , \"value\" : \"1QVYAqowEnOgwxDzJ_AeODbmkdVAcL2ZW6LlRTZoMxVo\" } ] , \"dynamic_slot_identifier\" : \"dynamic:google_sheets:1\" , \"labels\" : [ ] , \"value\" : \"1QVYAqowEnOgwxDzJ_AeODbmkdVAcL2ZW6LlRTZoMxVo\" // Value is set to \"List of Contacts\" } , { \"required\" : false , \"id\" : \"646333e5c7f3ab6e2bf4ed22\" , \"name\" : \"Select a Worksheet\" , \"has_dynamic_map_fields\" : false , \"field_type\" : \"select\" , \"options\" : [ { \"name\" : \"US\" , \"value\" : 0 } , { \"name\" : \"UK\" , \"value\" : 235386608 } , { \"name\" : \"Europe\" , \"value\" : 644453895 } ] , \"parent\" : \"646333dbc7f3ab6e2bf4ed12\" , \"dynamic_slot_identifier\" : \"dynamic:google_sheets:2\" , \"labels\" : [ ] , \"value\" : 0 // Value is set to \"US\" worksheet } , { \"required\" : false , \"id\" : \"646333f4c7f3ab6e2bf4ed4e\" , \"name\" : \"Select Headers\" , \"has_dynamic_map_fields\" : false , \"field_type\" : \"map\" , \"options\" : [ { \"name\" : \"Name\" , \"value\" : \"A\" } , { \"name\" : \"Email\" , \"value\" : \"B\" } , { \"name\" : \"Phone\" , \"value\" : \"C\" } ] , \"parent\" : \"646333e5c7f3ab6e2bf4ed22\" , \"dynamic_slot_identifier\" : \"dynamic:google_sheets:3\" , \"labels\" : [ { \"name\" : \"Header 1\" , \"value\" : \"6463340bc7f3ab6e2bf4edca\" } , { \"name\" : \"Header 2\" , \"value\" : \"6463340bc7f3ab6e2bf4edcb\" } , { \"name\" : \"Header 3\" , \"value\" : \"6463340bc7f3ab6e2bf4edcc\" } ] } ] , \"workflows\" : [ ] , \"config_id\" : \"1234\" } Field Mapping Rule Engine linkedin twitter Powered by Mintlify"

To incorporate repetitive actions or iterate over arrays within a workflow, users simply place the desired action nodes inside the Loop Node and provide values for the input fields based on their requirements. ​ Actions The Loop Node offers two distinct actions to choose from: Iterating Array Select this action when iterating over an array. When using this action, the user specifies the array to iterate over. Fixed Iteration Choose this action when you want to iterate a fixed number of times. With this action, users define the number of iterations. ​ Input Fields The input fields for the Loop Node vary based on the selected action. In case of Iterating Array , you need to provide the array which will determine the no. of times the loop will be executed while in Fixed iteration , you simply provide the Number of Iterations . ​ Accessing Array Item inside Loop Node To access the array item that is being passed in the Loop Node, within any node for each iteration, it can be done so by calling array_item object.

A Custom Code node is used to solve any data-related issues that required coding in the workflows. If the same code was needed at multiple places, the users need to use a Custom code node with the same code in different workflows. If you want to learn more about Custom Code Node, refer here . To reduct this repetitive process, the solution is the Functions node. Using this, you can create reusable functions at the global level for your Cobalt account, which can then be used inside workflows. ​ Create your Functions You can create your own functions to be used in the node by providing three things: Code for the function Input fields Output fields. Learn how to create your functions. Stay Tuned! ​ Pre-defined Library functions You can also use some pre-defined functions, also known as Library functions offered by Cobalt. These functions show up in the Functions node by default and can’t be edited. Few of the library functions are: Find element in array, Encrypt string, Get current date; & many more.

In certain scenarios where automatic re-authentication is not feasible, users may need to manually handle re-authentication. This process becomes necessary when either the refresh tokens expire, OAuth apps are deleted, integrations are disconnected, or access tokens are manually expired by the user. To facilitate this, you can identify the need for re-authentication and guide your users through the reconnection process effectively. ​ Determining the Need for Re-Authentication To determine if re-authentication is required, you can either use the List Applications API or .getApp() SDK method and check the reauth_required field in the response. By default, the field is false but if it returns true, then it indicates that re-authentication is necessary. Response [ { \"name\" : \"Drive\" , \"icon\" : \"https://cobalt-app-logos.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/google_drive/logo.png\" , \"description\" : \"Google Drive is Google's file sync app that lets you store all of your files online alongside your Google Docs documents, and keep them synced with all of your devices.\" , \"auth_type\" : \"oauth2\" , \"tags\" : [ \"Office\" ] , \"version\" : { \"_v\" : \"1.0.0\" , \"description\" : \"Google Drive is Google's file sync app that lets you store all of your files online alongside your Google Docs documents, and keep them synced with all of your devices.\" } , \"slug\" : \"google_drive\" , \"reauth_required\" : false // Re-Auth is not required. } , { \"name\" : \"Copper\" , \"icon\" : \"https://cobalt-app-logos.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/copper/logo.png\" , \"description\" : \"Copper is a customer relationship management (CRM) platform focused on automation and simplicity. It is built for businesses that use Google Workspace.\" , \"auth_type\" : \"keybased\" , \"tags\" : [ \"CRM\" ] , \"auth_input_map\" : [ { \"name\" : \"api_token\" , \"label\" : \"API Key\" , \"placeholder\" : \"Please enter the API key\" , \"required\" : true , \"type\" : \"text\" } , { \"name\" : \"email\" , \"label\" : \"Email Address\" , \"placeholder\" : \"Please enter the email of the token owner\" , \"required\" : true , \"type\" : \"text\" } ] , \"version\" : { \"_v\" : \"1.0.0\" , \"description\" : \"Copper is a customer relationship management (CRM) platform focused on automation and simplicity. It is built for businesses that use Google Workspace.\" } , \"slug\" : \"copper\" , \"reauth_required\" : true // Re-Auth is required. } ] ​ Manual Re-Authentication Process If the reauth_required field is true , then you need to get the user re-authenticated with the application.

After completing node-level testing, orchestrating tests allows users to assess the seamless execution of interconnected nodes, data flow, and overall workflow behavior. By simulating real-world scenarios and diverse payloads, users can ensure the reliability, scalability, and efficiency of their integrations. ​ Test Scenarios for Orchestration Testing ​ 1. End-to-End Workflow Testing Validate the entire workflow from start to finish to ensure all nodes function correctly in sequence. Try executing the Workflow through the Try API section. Test scenarios include: Triggering the workflow with different input data or payload. Verifying the expected output at the end of the workflow. For eg: If the Workflow is supposed to create a New Contact on a successful execution, then check whether the Contact was created or not in the account. ​ 2. Error Handling Testing Evaluate the system’s response to errors and exceptions within the workflow. Test scenarios include: Introducing errors at different nodes to test error recovery mechanisms. Verifying error notifications and logging. ​ 3. Performance Testing Assess the performance and scalability of the workflow under varying load conditions. Test scenarios include: Simulating high-volume data processing. Monitoring response times and resource utilization. ​ 4. Integration Point Validation Verify the integration points with external systems and services for data exchange. Test scenarios include: Testing API integrations with different payloads. Validating data consistency across integrated systems. ​ Execution and Verification Process Follow the steps mentioned below to perform Orchestration testing in Cobalt: 1. Prepare Test Data : Define test data and payloads in Events to simulate different scenarios. 2. Execute Orchestration Tests : Trigger the workflow with predefined test data through the Try API section to observe the behavior. 3. Monitor and Analyze : Monitor the workflow execution, data flow, and system responses for anomalies. 4. Verify Results : Compare the actual response with expected results to ensure the workflow functions as intended. To check the status of Workflow, navigate to Logs > Executions in Cobalt and check the workflow status. Learn more about Workflow logs here . 5. Iterate and Optimize : Identify areas for improvement, optimize performance, and refine the workflow based on Logs obtained. ​ Benefits of Orchestration Testing By performing Orchestration testing, you can ensure that the workflow has: Comprehensive Validation: Ensure the seamless integration and interaction of nodes within the workflow. Error Resilience: Validate error handling mechanisms and recovery processes for robust workflows. Performance Optimization: Identify bottlenecks, optimize resource utilization, and enhance workflow efficiency. End-to-End Reliability: Confirm the reliability and consistency of data processing and system interactions across the entire workflow. ​ Checkpoint + Next Step You have now successfully verified and tested your workflows.

If you want to learn about JSONata expression, refer here . ​ Input Fields The Transform node offers two input fields: Please note that both the input and query fields are required for the Transform node to function properly. ​ Input This field accepts a JSON object, where the Array needs to be given and can be selected from a DataSlot or a previous Node in the workflow. It serves as the input data for transformation. The format of the Input can be in the format: { \"input\" : \"{Array_name}\" // When you have the Array \"input\" : \"{{Node_name: data}}\" // When you want to fetch response of a previous node. // The Node_name is selected by using Nodes in Variables // \"input\" and \"data\" key can be replaced by any other word like result etc. } ​ Query In this field, users need to provide a valid JSONata expression to query or transform the input object. The expression structure in Query is given below. { \"output\" : \"JSONata expression\" // The key should be \"output\" in Query field. } If only the JSONata expression is provided in Query field rather than an object, then the node will give an empty response and result cannot be used in further nodes of the Workflow. ​ Node Rule Conditions The Transform node also supports Node Rule Conditions, allowing users to define conditions under which the transformation should occur. This provides additional control and flexibility in workflow execution based on specific criteria. By leveraging the Transform node in Cobalt workflows, users can efficiently process and manipulate JSON data, enabling seamless integration and automation of data-driven processes. Whether extracting specific information or performing complex transformations, the Transform node offers a powerful tool for managing JSON data within workflows. linkedin twitter Powered by Mintlify On this page Input Fields Input Query Node Rule Conditions"

Navigation UDF Parameter Documentation Implementation & Guides API Reference SDKs Resources Cobalt home page v2 Postman Get Your API Key Examples Developer Settings Overview Events API Proxy Platform Account Management Webhooks Tables by Cobalt Try API UDF Parameter UDF (User Defined Field) parameters in Cobalt offer a flexible mechanism for users to assign custom key-value pairs to Linked Accounts, allowing for enhanced control and customization within workflows. These parameters enable users to tailor workflows and configurations based on specific criteria defined by the UDF values. With the ability to create multiple UDF parameters for a single Linked Account, users gain granular control over workflow access and customization. ​ Creating UDF Parameters To create a UDF parameter for a Linked Account, follow these steps: Navigate to Linked Accounts in Cobalt and choose the Linked Account for which UDF needs to be added. Click on the Update UDF button in the right side. Specify the name of the UDF parameter and its corresponding value, click on + and click on the Save button. The UDF Parameter is added to the Linked account. This intuitive process allows users to define custom attributes for Linked Accounts. ​ Workflow Access Control UDF parameters play a crucial role in workflow access control within the Cobalt platform. Users can leverage UDF parameters to filter configurations for Linked Accounts, thereby controlling access to specific workflows based on predefined criteria. In the Config Portal of a Workflow, users have the option to define Access conditions, such as Match all conditions or Match any condition . Users can then specify the name of the UDF parameter and its corresponding value that should be allowed to access the Workflow. ​ Example Use Case Let’s consider a scenario where the user requires that only few users with the Admin rights can Reply in a Thread in Slack. To manage access to this workflow within Cobalt , the company can utilize UDF parameters. By assigning a UDF parameter named Role with values such as Administrator , Member and Guest to Linked Accounts, the company can filter configurations in workflows based on the role of each Linked Account. To use the UDF parameter in the workflow, the user will follow these steps: User will create UDF parameter named Role in the Linked accounts and assign them values. Navigate to Apps > Search for Slack > Workflows > Create a new workflow or Choose an existing one > Click on Config Portal in the top right corner. Learn how to create a workflow here . Go to Access > Select Match All Conditions > Enter Name as Role and Value as Administrator > Click on + > Click on Save . This workflow will now not be visible to the Linked Accounts who do not have the Role as Administrator. UDF parameters in Cobalt empower users to customize workflows, control access, and tailor configurations based on specific criteria defined by custom key-value pairs. By leveraging UDF parameters effectively, users can optimize workflow management and ensure efficient integration with their business processes. linkedin twitter Powered by Mintlify On this page Creating UDF Parameters Workflow Access Control Example Use Case"

Such mappings can be either static or dynamic depending upon your use case. In either case, you’d have to create a Map V2 type dataslot setting in your application or workflow configuration settings in Cobalt. A Map V2 type dataslot is a type of user config that allows your users to define a mapping between an object in your application (Source Column) and an object in their connected integration account (Destination Column) . ​ Static mapping Static mapping essentially means that you have a set of pre-defined fields for which you want your users to map the respective application fields. User can create the required labels by choosing Select as the type and entering the Options . On setting the static map type dataslot, the config returns the application fields along with the created labels. These labels consist of the name provided by you and system generated static value. This value is mapped to the application platform fields. \"fields\" : [ { \"required\" : false , \"id\" : \"65a0ee61b542ff4a62fe68b9\" , \"name\" : \"Map Deal Fields\" , \"field_type\" : \"map\" , \"options\" : [ { \"name\" : \"HubSpot Campaign\" , \"value\" : \"hs_campaign\" } , { \"name\" : \"Closed Won Date (Internal)\" , \"value\" : \"hs_closed_won_date\" } , { \"name\" : \"Global Term Line Item Discount Percentage\" , \"value\" : \"hs_line_item_global_term_hs_discount_percentage\" } , ... ] , \"labels\" : [ { \"name\" : \"Name\" , \"value\" : \"65a0ef4db542ff4a62fe6a0c\" } , { \"name\" : \"Amount\" , \"value\" : \"65a0ef4db542ff4a62fe6a0d\" } , { \"name\" : \"Request ID\" , \"value\" : \"65a0ef4db542ff4a62fe6a0e\" } ] , \"multiple\" : false , \"hidden\" : false } ] Next time when you’d like to update the value of the mapped field with some data, send the data against the system generated value . ​ Dynamic mapping Scenarios where the fields cannot be pre-defined for mapping and changes dynamically cannot be mapped using static mapping. For this Cobalt provides a feature to map your labels dynamically while creating your config. To do so, instead of creating the labels in the configuration pages specific to a workflow or the application, simply toggle the Dynamic option of the data slot and provide the Labels Object Name . Now while creating the config using .config() method, pass on the required dynamic labels under the created Labels Object Name . Check out this documentation for more details. cobalt . config ( { slug : \"hubspot\" , config_id : \"OPTIONAL_ID_FOR_THIS_CONFIG\" , labels : { \"Contact Fields\" : [ { \"name\" : \"First Name\" , \"value\" : \"first_name\" } , { \"name\" : \"Registration id\" , \"value\" : \"r_t353553gq12\" } ] } } ) Note here that unlike static mapping, the label value here is not system generated but defined by the user. ​ Getting map-type config from frontend SDK Use the config() function to get the config of a particular app. cobalt.config('mailerlite','configid'); Let’s look at a sample response of map-type dataslot. As you can see, the previously empty labels array now has the options configured above on the platform - ‘Name’ and ‘Email’. { \"application_data_slots\" : [ { \"required\" : true , \"id\" : \"645df2f8e77af6ed8d02f32f\" , \"name\" : \"Map Mailerlite Fields\" , \"has_dynamic_map_fields\" : false , \"field_type\" : \"map\" , \"options\" : [ { \"name\" : \"City\" , \"value\" : \"city\" } , { \"name\" : \"Company\" , \"value\" : \"company\" } , { \"name\" : \"Country\" , \"value\" : \"country\" } , { \"name\" : \"Last name\" , \"value\" : \"last_name\" } , { \"name\" : \"Name\" , \"value\" : \"name\" } , { \"name\" : \"Phone\" , \"value\" : \"phone\" } , { \"name\" : \"Secondary_Email\" , \"value\" : \"secondary_email\" } , { \"name\" : \"Zip\" , \"value\" : \"z_i_p\" } ] , \"dynamic_slot_identifier\" : \"dynamic:mailerlite:1\" , \"labels\" : [ { \"name\" : \"Name\" , \"value\" : \"645df30fe77af6ed8d02f338\" } , { \"name\" : \"Email\" , \"value\" : \"645df30fe77af6ed8d02f339\" } ] } ] , \"workflows\" : [ ] , \"config_id\" : \"1234\" } ​ Updating value of map-type config Use the updateConfig() function to save the selected value. In this case an object with respective labels and their values will be needed to pass. cobalt . updateConfig ( 'pipedrive' , '1234' , { \"config_id\" : \"1234\" , \"application_data_slots\" : { \"645df2f8e77af6ed8d02f32f\" : { \"645df30fe77af6ed8d02f339\" : \"secondary_email\" , \"645df30fe77af6ed8d02f338\" : \"name\" } /*[response.application_data_slots[0].id] : { [ response . application_data_slots [ 0 ] . labels [ 0 ] . value ] : response . application_data_slots [ 0 ] . options [ 4 ] . value [ response . application_data_slots [ 0 ] . labels [ 1 ] . value ] : response . application_data_slots [ 0 ] . options [ 6 ] . value } * / } , \"workflows\" : [ ] } ) ; It will return the same response as config() functions with updates in the changed value. You will notice that the value is now added in the object. { \"application_data_slots\" : [ { \"required\" : true , \"id\" : \"645df2f8e77af6ed8d02f32f\" , \"name\" : \"Map Mailerlite Fields\" , \"has_dynamic_map_fields\" : false , \"field_type\" : \"map\" , \"options\" : [ { \"name\" : \"City\" , \"value\" : \"city\" } , { \"name\" : \"Company\" , \"value\" : \"company\" } , { \"name\" : \"Country\" , \"value\" : \"country\" } , { \"name\" : \"Last name\" , \"value\" : \"last_name\" } , { \"name\" : \"Name\" , \"value\" : \"name\" } , { \"name\" : \"Phone\" , \"value\" : \"phone\" } , { \"name\" : \"Secondary_Email\" , \"value\" : \"secondary_email\" } ] , \"dynamic_slot_identifier\" : \"dynamic:mailerlite:1\" , \"labels\" : [ { \"name\" : \"Name\" , \"value\" : \"645df30fe77af6ed8d02f338\" } , { \"name\" : \"Email\" , \"value\" : \"645df30fe77af6ed8d02f339\" } ] , \"value\" : { \"645df30fe77af6ed8d02f339\" : \"secondary_email\" , \"645df30fe77af6ed8d02f338\" : \"name\" } } ] , \"workflows\" : [ ] , \"config_id\" : \"1234\" } What are Field Types Dependent Dataslot linkedin twitter Powered by Mintlify On this page Static mapping Dynamic mapping Getting map-type config from frontend SDK Updating value of map-type config"

By adding a Delay node to the workflow, users can control the timing of subsequent actions. ​ Delay Node Actions The Delay node offers two types of actions: Wait for Specifies that the workflow should wait for the specified duration before proceeding. Wait till Specifies that the workflow should wait until the specified time period is reached before proceeding. Wait Till has 2 additional Input fields, Before or After Base Date and the Base Date field. ​ Steps to Use Delay Node To incorporate a Delay node into a workflow, follow these steps: 1 Create Workflow Begin by navigating to the respective app and creating a new workflow. Add an event and publish the workflow to activate it. Learn more about Workflows here . 2 Add Delay Node Within the workflow, add a Delay node as per your requirement along with other nodes to define the workflow flow. 3 Configure Delay Action In the Delay node, select the action type as either Wait for or Wait till depending on the desired behavior. Specify the duration of the delay by entering the desired values for Days , Hours , Minutes , and Seconds . By default, the values will be set as 0 for all the input fields. Currently Cobalt supports only integral values for the Input fields in Delay Node. During workflow execution, the Delay node introduces a pause in execution for the specified time period before proceeding to the next action. If the rule condition is specified for the Delay node and it is met, then the workflow will execute as per the defined delay duration else the Delay node will be skipped.

Workflows consist of Triggers and Actions , allowing for seamless automation and data flow between applications. With Workflows, users can easily implement common integration use cases such as pushing data from their application to users’ apps, receiving real-time updates through webhooks, and enabling non-technical teams to configure integrations without coding. Here are some examples of Workflows for popular integrations: Slack Send notifications from your application to Slack channels. Salesforce Sync contacts from your application to Salesforce CRM. HubSpot Sync contacts between HubSpot and your application. Google Calendar Create events in Google Calendar based on events in your application. The Workflow Builder simplifies the integration process, empowering developers to create seamless and efficient data flows between applications with ease. ​ Triggers All workflows start with a trigger , which determines when the workflow will run and how data is passed into the workflow. Triggers are setup in the Start Node of workflow. Available workflow trigger types include: App Events App Events are custom events that are sent from your application via the Cobalt SDK or API to trigger Workflows. In general, App Events are useful for triggering workflows that map data from your application to your users’ apps. For example, you might send a Contact Created App Event from your application to trigger a Workflow that creates a matching contact in your users’ Salesforce CRM. An App Event can be used to trigger multiple workflows. This is useful in cases where you may want the same event to trigger similar workflows across different integrations. Learn more about Events in our guide here . Default App Triggers Default App triggers can be used to run workflows based on events in your users’ apps. For example, you might want to trigger a workflow whenever new contacts are created in your users’ Salesforce account, to sync contacts to your application in real-time. Schedule The Scheduler trigger is used for workflows that should run automatically at a scheduled time or interval. Minutes (e.g. every 30 minutes) Hourly (e.g. every hour at 15 minutes past the hour) Daily (e.g. every 2 days at 9:00 am) The minimum time that can be set in scheduler should be greater than 5 minutes. Once deployed, the workflow will run automatically at the designated time for all users who have activated the workflow. Workflow API The Workflow API in Cobalt allows users to execute workflows programmatically instead of relying on event-based triggers. This API-based execution provides flexibility in triggering workflows directly through an API call. Know more about Workflow API here . ​ Actions Workflow actions helps you to create complex workflows. You can drag and drop them on the workflow canvas as nodes of a workflow, inter-connect and configure them to achieve required flow. These actions can be broadly categorized as: Cobalt's Native actions These actions do not make any API calls themselves but help as utility tools for making workflows. There are various utility nodes currently provided by Cobalt. You can learn more about any of the node by clicking on its card below. Custom Code This action takes input parameters and uses them to manipulate the data using custom code. Delay Delay allows you to pause the execution of next step till a certain time. Loop This action is used to loop over an entity or a flow for a number of iterations. HTTP HTTP Node allows you to create an HTTP Request to any API of the integration. Internal Functions This action is used to create re-usable functions or use pre-defined library functions in the workflow. Merge The Merge Node allows you to merge multiple branches of a workflow into a single flow. PDF PDF node helps you to convert HTML to a PDF. Response Response node lets you notify you about the Subscribed Webhook events and define the data that needs to be sent to you along with the notification. Rule You can add conditional logic to workflows using our rule node. Send Email Send Email node lets you send an email through the workflow. Tables Tables node helps you create variables at runtime and add values to them. Transform This node lets you transform complex JSON into an easily accessible format. Cobalt's custom actions You can create API Proxies of your organization to use, in the Developer settings. Third party application actions Cobalt supports 100+ third party applications on its platform. Users can connect to these applications through Cobalt to make use of their APIs. When you select an application from the Apps list to create a workflow, you can find it’s Native node in the right panel along with the other actions. Drag and drop it on the workflow canvas to make use of the the application’s APIs supported by Cobalt. HTTP Request Users can also make any custom API call to the selected application that is not available with Cobalt as an action using the HTTP request. Simply setup the API in the node with all the required params like Method , URL , Request Body etc. and you are good to go.

This will help you achieve greater reliability, accuracy, and performance after launch. In this guide, we’ll help you build a testing plan to identify potential issues early and ensure that your application is working effectively. ​ 1. Develop comprehensive test scenarios Create a testing plan that outlines various scenarios, edge cases, and expected outcomes for your integration in Cobalt. Include both successful and unsuccessful cases, such as proper handling of errors types. Ensure that your test plan covers all relevant aspects of your Cobalt API integration, including authorization, API requests, data processing, and data storage. ​ 2. Writing Automated tests Leverage automated testing tools and frameworks to run your tests and validate common and uncommon API or method call responses. Automated testing will help you identify any issues or inconsistencies (like empty data fields or config) in your integration, and allow you to quickly address them before deploying your application to production. Regularly update your test cases as your integration involves more workflows to ensure comprehensive coverage: How does your application respond when a user needs to be reauthenticated? Learn more about How to handle ReAuth in Cobalt in our Additional section. How is a user properly disconnected from the integration? ​ 3. Perform manual testing of Cobalt auth flows In addition to automated tests, perform manual testing of the frontend Cobalt auth flow to validate its proper functionality and desired user experience. This may include end-to-end testing, where you simulate a user’s interaction with your application and verify that the integration connects correctly and subsequent API calls are initiated. What happens after Cobalt Connect closes after a successful connection? Where does the user go next? What happens after Cobalt Connect modal closes unsuccessfully (like invalid user credentials)? ​ 4. Conduct regular reviews Periodically review your Cobalt integration to ensure it continues to meet your application’s needs and performance requirements. Look for opportunities to optimize your integration, such as refining your workflows, improving error handling, or exploring new Cobalt integrations. ​ Checkpoint + Next Step After completing this step, you now have a robust and reliable integration on your end that meets the needs of your users. Next, we will see how you can perform Node level tests of your Workflows. Get Data with API Proxies Node Level Tests linkedin twitter Powered by Mintlify On this page 1.

To setup your Shopify app in Cobalt for OAuth, you will need the following credentials from your Shopify Partner Dashboard : Client ID Client Secret Scopes ​ Pre-requisites Shopify Developer account or Shopify Partners account. You can create one here . Shopify development store. Follow the steps here to create a development store. If you haven’t already created an app in Shopify, you’d need to create one. ​ Creating an app in Shopify To create a Shopify app and aquire the above mentioned credentials, please follow the steps mentioned below: Log in to your Shopify Partner Dashboard . Click on Apps in the left menu of the Dashboard. Click on the Create App button in the top right and choose Create App Manually . Enter the unique App Name for your application and click on Create . In Cobalt , go to your Apps catalog > Search for Shopify > Settings > Use your credentials > Callback Url . Copy the Callback URL as provided in your Shopify settings page. In the App settings in Shopify Partner Dashboard, navigate to Build > Configuration > URLs section > Remove the default URL present in Allowed redirection URL(s) > Paste the copied Callback Url > Click on the Save and Release button in the top side > Release . Navigate to Overview in the left menu and copy the Client ID and Client Secret from the Client credentials section. ​ Configuring credentials in Cobalt App settings page lets you configure the authentication settings for an OAuth2 based application. For your customers to provide you authorization to access their data, they would first need to install your application. This page lets you set up your application credentials. Cobalt lets you use pre-configured applications to play around. You can do so by selecting Use our credentials . However, if you wish to use your own application, select Use your own credentials . Provide the aquired Client Id and Client secret and save it. ​ Configuring Scopes Cobalt lets you configure what permissions to ask from your users while they install your application. The scopes can be added or removed from the App settings page, under Permissions & Scopes section. For some applications Cobalt sets mandatory scopes which cannot be removed. Additional scopes can be selected from the drop down. Cobalt also has the provision to add any custom scopes supported by the respective platform. Once the scopes has been added to the application in Cobalt, the app will now request for access of the mentioned scopes. If you are facing scopes missing or invalid scope error. Make sure you are not passing any custom scope not supported by the platform. ​ Access to protected customer data Some Shopify APIs alongwith the scopes, also require access to protected customer data . For eg. Abandoned checkouts, Draft Order etc. To Request Access of protected customer data : In the left menu of the App, select API access . Scroll down to Access requests section > Protected customer data access > Request access . Select Protected customer data , provide your reasons for using it, and click Save . Complete rest of the requirements and submit the app for review.

Choose Public distribution from Select a distribution method . You can’t change the distribution method after you select it, so make sure that you understand the different capabilities and requirements of each type. Click on Select and confirm the distribution selected. ​ Going Live with Shopify Once you have tested the Shopify integration with Cobalt using a test shop, it is time to publish your application so that other production shops of different organizations can install/authorize your application. Shopify mandates publishing and listing of your application in order to be installed by other users from different organizations. This requires a review from the Shopify team who make sure that the application is installed through their marketplace as well and not just through the installation URL generated through Cobalt’s SDKs. To list your application on Shopify, the following steps need to be followed: ​ 1. Setup App URL page As soon as the user clicks to install your application on Shopify’s marketplace, they are redirected to the App URL provided by you in the Shopify app configuration. Make sure a page exists for the URL provided or create a new page. This page would be responsible for handling installation requests. When the user is redirected to the App URL page, you can access the shop_name from the URL argument shop . Create another page to handle the redirect URL. Then using the Redirect page URI , Client ID , Shop name and required scopes, generate the following Shopify auth URL and open it in the browser for the user redirected to the App URL page. This opens up the Shopify permission page. https : / / { Shop_Name } / admin / oauth / authorize ? client_id = { SHOPIFY_CLIENT_ID } & redirect_uri = { REDIRECT_CALLBACK_URL } & scope = { SHOPIFY_SCOPES } ​ 2. Setting up Redirect URL page In the previous step, we created a page to handle redirect URI and used that to generate the Shopify auth URL. Add the Redirect URL as one of the Allowed Redirection URLs in the application configuration. Once the user allows permissions from the Shopify permission page, the user is redirected to to this page. The URL consists of the shop name and a code . ​ 3. Acquiring access token from redirect URL Make use of the shop name and code from the previous step to make an API call to get the Access token. curl -- location -- request POST 'https : / / { Shop - Name } . myshopify . com / admin / oauth / access_token ? client_id = { Client - ID } & client_secret = { Client - Secret } & code = { Code } ' Replace the Client ID and Client Secret with your valid credentials. This will provide you with a response consisting of the access token and shop name . Migrate the acquired token to Cobalt. ​ 4. Migrating access token to Cobalt Once the access token is acquired, send it to Cobalt for further handling API authentications, token expiries and retries. curl -- location -- request PUT 'https://api.gocobalt.io/api/v2/public/migrate-token' \\ -- header 'x-api-key: {{Cobalt API KEY}}' \\ -- header 'linked_account_id: {{LINKED_ACCOUNT_ID}}' \\ -- header 'Content-Type: application/json' \\ -- data ' { \"slug\" : \"shopify\" , \"auth_object\" : { \"access_token\" : { { Access Token } } , \"store_name\" : { { Store Name } } } } ' Replace the API key, linked account ID, access token and store name with the valid values. ​ 5. Subscribing to mandatory privacy webhooks Shopify requires you to provide compliance webhook URLs to publish applications to the marketplace. They use this webhook URL to notify regarding Customer data requests , Customer data erasure , and Shop data erasure so that relevant action be taken. Copy the Single webhook URL from the Cobalt Shopify app setting page and paste them as Shopify Compliance webhooks URLs in the Shopify app configuration page. Click Save and release at the top to save your changes. Creating workflows to respond to privacy webhooks Next, create 3 workflows that listen for these triggers in the workflow builder and publish them for all users: Customer data request (Customer Data Requested Trigger) Customer data erasure (Delete Customer Data Requested Trigger) Shop data erasure (Delete Shop Data Requested Trigger) ​ Actions and triggers Once the above setup is completed, you can create orchestrations of your use-cases using Shopify actions and triggers. Following are the set of Shopify actions and triggers supported by Cobalt. Actions Triggers Inventory Get Inventory Items - Get all inventory items in Shopify.

Before clicking on Save , make sure that you have entered data for all the mandatory fields whichever required. Connect all the nodes by clicking on + button on the node and dragging the arrow to the Jira node. ​ 4. Publishing the Workflow To publish the workflow, click on the Publish button in the top, Select Environments of the Workflow and click on Publish . ​ Enabling the Workflow To enable a workflow, end user or a Linked Account needs to Toggle On the Workflow after connecting with the application. Navigate to the Linked Account in which the Workflow needs to be enabled by getting its’ Hosted URL . Go to the Hosted URL and select Jira from Manage your Integrations list. Click on the Connect button > Review the permissions and allow them for a successful connection. After a successful connection, you can see the Configure section in the Pardot Application page.
