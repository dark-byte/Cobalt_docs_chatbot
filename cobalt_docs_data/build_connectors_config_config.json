Users can create a new dataslot to store a value from selected or entered by your users. Some examples of dataslots are: Slack - Select a channel where messages will be posted Greenhouse/Lever - Select a job where candidates will be added Hubspot/Pipedrive - Select a stage to which the deal has to be added Docusign - Select a template from which a document will be sent to a signer ​ Create config dataslots on Cobalt’s platform The first thing is to add a new config dataslot inside each application by clicking on Config Portal . There are different types of config dataslots such as Select, Mapping, JSON, text and more. Look at the below example to set a new config dataslot. ​ Handling multiple configs Handling multiple configs is an advanced feature for users who want to store and run different configs for a single workflow. To do so, we need to set a unique id while calling the config() and updateConfig() functions. ​ Step 1: Setting a unique config id You can set a unique config while calling the .config() function as shown below. Make sure that config ids are stored on your end. cobalt . config ( 'pipedrive' , 'configid-1' ) ; //creating a config using an id 'configid-1' cobalt . config ( 'pipedrive' , 'configid-2' ) ; //creating a config using another id 'configid-2' Similarly, while calling the updateConfig() function make sure that you also use the respective config id. ​ Step 2: Using Config id while triggering events While triggering a new event from the backend SDK, you need to pass the respective config id to use the stored value inside the config. // Send the \"New Contact Created\" App Event try { const data = await Client . event ( { linked_account_id : \"<Account Id of the user eg: example@someemail.com>\" , event : \"New Contact Created\" , config_id : \"configid-2\" , //event will trigger a workflow using configid-2 payload : { \"name\" : \"Jeff Atwood\" , \"email\" : \"jeff@stackoverflow.com\" , \"phone\" : \"4151231234\" , \"company\" : \"Stack Overflow\" , \"role\" : \"Founder\" } } ) } catch ( error ) { //Catch any error } Overview What are Field Types linkedin twitter Powered by Mintlify On this page Create config dataslots on Cobalt’s platform Handling multiple configs Step 1: Setting a unique config id Step 2: Using Config id while triggering events"
