This stored response in the Response Node can be viewed by navigating to Logs of that workflow in Cobalt. It provides users with visibility into the data generated by the instance during execution. â€‹ Configuring Data Input The Data input field allows users to specify the desired data from the response. Users can choose from a variety of options, including selecting DataSlots or choosing Nodes that have completed before the Response Node in the workflow. Once selected, users can further refine their choice to extract specific fields or data from the response. One of the key functionalities of the Response Node is its ability to simplify the extraction of specific data from the response generated by previous actions in the workflow. Users can specify the exact data they require by configuring the Data Input field within the node. PDF Node Rule Node linkedin twitter Powered by Mintlify On this page Configuring Data Input"
