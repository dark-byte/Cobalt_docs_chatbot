The references in Data Refs allow you to unify IDs from various systems under a single record in Cobalt. Record ID refers to the ID you create while External ID refers to the ID of that entity in the integration. For example, consider a Data Ref named Users : By maintaining these mappings, Data Refs allow you to quickly access and update information across integrations. Each Linked Account in Cobalt maintains its own distinct Data Refs, even if they share the same name and you can filter the Data Refs for a Linked Account in Cobalt dashboard. ​ Data Refs in Dashboard All Data Refs can be accessed and managed through the Data Refs section in the dashboard: Navigate to Settings > Data Refs and view the details such as Name, Associated Linked account ID and the records. ​ Data Refs Actions Data Refs node offers a range of actions which can be used in a Workflow: Create Ref This action allows user to create a record in a Data Ref. If the Data Ref doesn’t exist for the Linked Account, a new Data Ref with the record is created. Create Bulk Refs This action allows user to create records in bulk in a Data Ref. If the Data Ref doesn’t exist for the Linked Account, a new Data Ref with the records is created.
