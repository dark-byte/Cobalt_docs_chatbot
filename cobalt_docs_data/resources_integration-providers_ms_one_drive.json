Additional scopes can be selected from the drop down. Cobalt also has the provision to add any custom scopes supported by the respective platform. Once the scopes has been added to the application in Cobalt, go to your Microsoft Azure account and update the scopes as added on Cobalt. Select the OAuth App created for Cobalt and follow Step 7 and 8 above . If you are facing scopes missing or invalid scope error. Make sure you are not passing any custom scope not supported by the platform.
