These custom apps function similarly to other pre-built integrations available in Cobalt, allowing users to tailor their automation processes according to their specific needs. ​ Creating Custom Apps Custom Apps can be created within the Apps section of Cobalt, alongside other available integrations. When creating a custom app, users have the option to specify various details such as the Name , Category , Description and Slug to identify the app within the Cobalt platform. Custom App will also have a tag Custom written on their card in the App list. Learn in detail about how you can create a Custom App in Cobalt here . ​ Authentication Methods Custom Apps support multiple authentication methods. To setup the Authorization for the Custom App, navigate to Authorization in the App and choose the desired method. The methods of Authorization are: ​ Key Based If the Custom App requires API Key based authentication, select Key Based . It requires users to set up an API for generating access tokens. ​ OAuth 1.0 If the App requires OAuth 1.0 auth, select Oauth1 . It requires the user to provide information like Auth token API , Token Type , Token Field name etc. ​ OAuth 2.0 If you want to provide OAuth 2.0 type authorization, select OAuth 2.0 in the methods. Users need to provide details such as Client ID , Client ID Param Name , Client Secret , Redirect URL , Auth and Token URLs , Scopes etc., along with the API for acquiring the access token. ​ No Auth Select this option if no authentication is required for accessing the custom app. ​ App Configuration Similar to the pre-built integrations on Cobalt, users can configure various aspects in the Custom App, including Actions , Workflows , and App-specific configurations. App configuration allows users to fine-tune the behavior of the custom app according to their requirements. ​ Adding Actions and Workflows Custom Apps support the addition of Actions and Workflows, enabling users to define specific tasks and automation processes within the app. Actions can be created to perform specific functions or interact with external systems similar to the API Proxy in Cobalt, while Workflows allow users to orchestrate a series of actions to achieve complex automation scenarios.
